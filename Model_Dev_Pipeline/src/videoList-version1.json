        "Comment 1: WATCH NEXT: We hear from the team that investigated the culture of no-compromise gun ownership, industry money, and political dysfunction that has made it so difficult to make meaningful change in the US. - https://youtu.be/Py62uYJylRs\n\nCheck out more VICE News on VICE TV starting at 10p Thursdays.\n",
        "Comment 2: Congo's natural mineral potential is valued at $35 trillion, yet is one of the poorest countries in the world. It's crazy.\n",
        "Comment 3: I'm a Peruvian and I met a congolese person while going through a hard life situation.  He was a smart well spoken person who explained the history and situation of the DRC in a concise manner.  I learned from him.  I have great respect for african people, they are our brothers.  I wish nothing but peace and prosperity for the DRC and Africa in general.\n",
        "Comment 4: Love Vice News’ return to true frontline reporting that we don’t see in other media outlets\n",
        "Comment 5: As a congolese born and raised in Eastern congo, i have seen my fair share of these conflicts and the damage are just unspeakable. First all congratulations to the journalist on giving word to each faction without introducing any bias (and she brave af). Sadly as one comment mentionned before, the only people who are hurt are us. The central government couldn't care less as long as they keep receving the monthly royalties from the exploitation of minerals. For long people have been screaming that the central government left us, but now for their great relief, attention is shifting toward an other enemy (Rwanda, M23) etc.\n\nIf we talking peace finally in the east, HOW EXACTLY is it going to come? Because strategically, the burst of violence from time to time is very beneficial to a ruling party (suprise elections are coming by the way). Every fucking body just want his share. Locals are brainwashed into thinking the other is the enemy while billions are being sent everyday to the central government from exploitations of minerals (they are not all illegal). When everything you have in your life is to survive, it is easy to be manipulated. For those of us who were there during the 2000 genocides, what has changed?? Arming locals to go fight a war that should have been handled by the government is you just creating hundreds of militias again once you give them gun. No training, extrememly biased, no control, we are just going from bad to worse. Are we going to fight M23 out? they were out and we wasn't fine exactly. then what happens to those you just gave guns and no plan for reintegration?\n\n\nSeriously someone answer me because i am just lost\n",
        "Comment 6: As a Congolese I wish most Congolese realize this war is big part  media and business. We have to wake-up and stop expecting a change if Rwanda leaves. It's all on us to stop corruption, tribalism and selling our country for little money. Every war happening in Congo despite all accusations has a Congolese who opened way,its on us to take responsibility\n",
        "Comment 7: I'm from Kenya, and I can tell you Kenya's desire to have peace in Congo is genuine. There are tens of thousands of Congolese in kenya (probably more than a hundred thousand), some who came in the late 60s and early 70s, and recently  two years ago, there has been a surge of Congolese youths into Kenya. They are hawking shoes, clothing,  food stuff, and so many working in barbershop across all cities and towns in Kenya. We love them as our brothers and sisters and we wish Congo becomes stable so that most of these young men and women, who appear to be also highly educated to go back home and work as professionals as  trained in schools, colleges and universities. Some are trained high school teachers working as shoes hawkers. Kenyas' interest in the conflict is genuine.\n",
        "Comment 8: Congo is for the Congolese people... blessings from Jamaica 🇯🇲\n",
        "Comment 9: More context for why there are Tutsi rebels in the DRC: It's a spillover from the Rwandan Civil War. Basically, Hutu soldiers fled to what was then Zaire after Tutsis won, These soldiers attacked Tutsis in Zaire, Rwanda saw the former Hutu Power officials who wanted to return to power next door as a security threat and wanted them disarmed, Mobutu did nothing as financial support for him stopped after the Cold War ended, Rwanda invaded with other nations to stop the rebels during the First Congo War, Mobutu was toppled, innocent ordinary Hutus fled, and the violence never ended since then. \r\n\r\nDRC has such a tragic history that has left them in this loop of violence and absolute cruelty and inhumanity towards this populace. A real example of legacy and generational trauma being passed down and blunting any type of progress. Europeans buying minerals from Rwanda. Europeans chopping off Congolese hands, limbs and violently exploiting their populace for the country's resources, has left a society of people who know nothing else. The cycle of exploitation, violence and death continues.\n",
        "Comment 10: These things really just go to show how often we take our peace for granted. Most of us couldn’t even fathom being born into this life let alone living in it. May god grant the DRC and every other nation facing similar challenges peace.\n",
        "Comment 11: The language choices by the Congolese players are fascinating as always. \nThe people signing up to the militia in Goma speak Swahili, but they call M23 by a French name. French-influenced Swahili has a long history in the region. And, interestingly, it was also spoken by Tutsi fighters who returned to Rwanda in the 90s and defeated the genocidal govt. \nThe militia in the field speak something I don't recognise - I assume they're Maimai and it's their local language? Although it could be Kinyarwanda if they're Congolese/Congo-born Hutu?\nKinshasa elites are speaking French, as expected... but so are the M23. You'd think M23 would use English with an anglo journalist, since the Rwandan govt elites who are accused of funding M23 prefer English to French due to complex reasons (eg the french govt supporting the former genocidal regime)... but nope, M23 are using French (EDIT: M23 also use English, Swahili and Kinyrawanda depending on the audience)). \nM23 are talking about the murder of fellow Kinyarwanda speakers in Kinshasa (ie Hutu AND Tutsi)... but not the murder of Tutsi-looking people. They're focusing on the language, not the ethnicity. Meanwhile, Rwanda sits on the sidelines and replies to media in English.\n\nIt's all extremely subtle and political - Goma recruiters want a broad local ethnic base so they use the main language of Goma, not their mother tongue. Kinshasa wants to not show a Lingala bias (or Luba, for that matter!) (EDIT: It is very standard for national authorities to use French). The Maimai want to show a strong ethnic identity and the M23 want to avoid showing a Tutsi ethnic identity and instead show that they're Congolese and fit for power in Kinshasa... and while also being mainly concerned for Kinyarwanda speakers (who are ethnic Tutsi). So they speak French, instead of Swahili, English, or Kinyarwanda. And Rwanda? It just wants to be invisible.\n\nIf you are confused, that's very normal. It's an extremely complex part of the world. \n\n(EDIT: Shout out to @ellieallien1464 and others for their useful info in the comments! I'm not interested in looking smart, I'm interested in sharing my modest knowledge about this very important subject :) )\n",
        "Comment 12: I really respect her style of interviewing. She doesn't back down from hard questions even when those questions could put her in danger.\n",
        "Comment 13: Lumumba tried to prevent this for his people decades ago. It's so sad to see what has become of the Congo.\n",
        "Comment 14: That chant in the beginning was 🔥🔥🔥\n",
        "Comment 15: Thank you to all the Vice team for your courage. Which companies and countries are buying from Rwanda and Uganda? Both of them  don't have coltan industrial mines. Sanctions should be applied on clients if the world really wanted this conflitcs to end it  would have stopped long ago\n",
        "Comment 16: Mad respect\n",
        "Comment 17: Prayers for the people of Congo\n",
        "Comment 18: My uncle served in the DRC in the 90's training soldiers through the Zimbabwean peacekeeping mission. I am so proud of him. Rest in peace baba omdala.\n",
        "Comment 19: This documentary is amazing as a Congolese born in the Congo bought up in London . We are aware of what is happening . The hunger and fighting spirit I saw when I was in Congo a few months ago really inspired me we will fight till the end ! Congo eloko ya makasi mboka ya ba koko 🇨🇩🇨🇩🇨🇩🇨🇩.\n",
        "Comment 20: This is so saddening. The continued generational trauma on all sides is so hard to see and my heart goes out to everyone involved.\n",
        "Comment 21: The Congo is such a beautiful place of Mother Nature, and the people, like people everywhere, are wonderful- who just want to live in peace and happiness... It breaks my heart that such a beautiful country is torn by war and corruption... I am always praying for you, Congo 🙏🩷💓🩷💓🙏\n",
        "Comment 22: This totally reminds me of old Vice! Back to the frontlines and covering stories that need to be heard. Very well done!\n",
        "Comment 23: It's sad. Most of these men, signing up to fight, they don't look angry. They look sad, and desperate. They are fighting to try to keep their families and homes safe, but they look so dejected. I suppose that they are not sure, even in themselves, if they would really lose anything if the rebels took over. They just sign up to fight for the current order of things, to avoid the uncertainty of what would otherwise come. I hope that it can all come to an end soon.\n",
        "Comment 24: The hymn in the beginning was beautiful. They have acclimated to conflict and war so much that these soldiers embrace death.\n",
        "Comment 25: That song at the beginning was so hard\n",
        "Comment 26: I wrote an assignment about the DR Congo, back in 2016. About what impact the evolution of tech had meant/would mean, for the civilians and the goverment there. This was heart-breaking to watch.\n",
        "Comment 27: it's almost as if the rest of the world needs sub-Saharan Africa in a constant state of war or poverty in order to be profitable\n",
        "Comment 28: Respect to vice for this type of journalism. The issues that are hard to gain access,  difficult to organize, and too dangerous is what we want to hear about.\n",
        "Comment 29: I’m Rwandan and I wish peace to our brothers and sisters in Congo. My Father studied in Congo and I have some relatives there. In Rwanda we really have no problem with Congolese people. We love their culture, music(my father in particular), I had amazing hardworking congolese teachers in secondary school and we love doing business with congolese people.\nJust because there are Kinyarwanda speaking people in M23 doesn’t mean that Rwanda supports them!! I don’t even know much about them! I understand and I know the struggle Congo has been going through for decades but please don’t mislead the anger and hate towards the wrong people! Rwanda and Congo should be in peace and solve this problem together! 🇨🇩❤🇷🇼(not coming from a politician but a normal Rwandan citizen).\n",
        "Comment 30: Thank you to vice for speaking and tackling this issue, while so many media outlets have ignored, im truly heartbroken for my country of origin and I always try to bring attention to this.\n",

        "Comment 32: the cinematography on this was dope\n",
        "Comment 33: Got chills from the chant in the beginning...\n",
        "Comment 34: Excellent journalism....This is as good as it gets. No emotions, or reporters dictating the conversation. You have both sides of the conflict saying their side of the story.\n",
        "Comment 35: Thats chant in the beginning gives you chills\n",
        "Comment 36: But they want me to worry about Palestinians and Israel. My attention will be on the Congo\n",
        "Comment 37: my country will rise once again. congolese people are so hard working and deserve so much better than this. our governments have failed us. love to all my people 🇨🇩\n",
        "Comment 38: Been doing my research paper on DRC it is so disturbing and sad what the peoples are going through at the hands of M23 and former rebel groups.  So many families face trauma on a daily basis I pray God have his mercy on this land 🙏.   Learning of this has left me with unspeakable grief for my brothers and sisters this silent unspoken story needs more media coverage.\n",
        "Comment 39: BIG SUPPORT for the guy who said peace does not come from outsiders , I believe that every party that finds its way to Congo will leave once their desires are fulfilled, Kenyans are there to pave way for Africa's business  which means peace for Congo but without the consent of the Congolese netizens, its a loosing battle for us too . Congo its time for you to stand up and fight for your rights against all those international organizations which aim to not only meddle with Congo's business but also with Africa's existence (( ukoloni mamboleo)), viva to all those fighting for peace,,, I regret passing my message in a colonizers language,,, #kenya loves Congo we'd want to see you happy\n",

        "Comment 47: God damn she interviewed that General in front such a large crowd. Incredible bravery really inspiring.\n",
        "Comment 48: The song at the start was bangin\n",
        "Comment 49: i want to hear this whole intro song with no commentary.\n",
        "Comment 50: One thing I noticed was the lack of old men. Chilling to think that it is because the men are dying in such large numbers that few of them make it to old age.\n",
        "Comment 51: The cinematography between 18:42 - 19:05 is impeccable.\n",
        "Comment 52: That chant at the start sounds so good 0:01\n\nSong name?\n",
        "Comment 53: and to think the very laptop, iPad or cell phone you are watching this on could possibly have coltan originating from the Congo deep inside its guts...   crazy notion to think about whenever you use your electronics, you could be quite possibly fuelling conflicts.\n",
        "Comment 54: The Congolese deserve peace more than any other people .\n",
        "Comment 55: Vice does some of the best journalism on international affairs.  If you have a bias filter and don't take sides they provide some of the best objective reporting.  If you go into their reports with your bias, they're going to appear left, but true Vice just reports what the people are thinking/feeling on the ground in these conflict zones.  Their roots are what journalism should be and they've been killing it recently with pieces like this.\n",
        "Comment 56: Prayers for everyone fighting for the right. Woman and men may God be with you at all times ❤️❤️ Congolese are beautiful people and land is so rich.\n",
        "Comment 57: My heart hurts for the children\n",
        "Comment 58: My wife is working in Congo. Im so worried about what is happening in the country. But im so proud of her to. I feel for all the people of Congo both rebells and all the people. Its a curse that Congo has so much minerals.\n",
        "Comment 59: As Ukrainian, I fully support Vice journalism in how it was covering the war in Ukraine from 2014 onwards up to 2023. I hope Kongolese people finally achieve peace and will prosper alongside other proud peoples\n",
        "Comment 60: No one is born to die but born to preserve\n",
        "Comment 61: I was lowkey wishing this was a scene from a movie🥺💔 It’s too heartbreaking to be real!\n",
        "Comment 62: \"Only the dead have seen the end of war\". \n- Plato\n",
        "Comment 63: God bless and protect the people of Congo eho have been fighting for their freedom and safety since i was a small child.\n",
        "Comment 64: that song sung by the group at the beginning is so good.\n",
        "Comment 65: What's the name of the song in the beginning?\n",
        "Comment 66: I’m from Congo Kinshasa! It very sad what is happening in Congo now but I know one day everything will be ok in Congo 🇨🇩🇨🇩🇨🇩🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾\n",
        "Comment 67: Very interesting and well done here. Sadly, the conflict in DRC, while succinctly explained in many ways in this piece, seems to lack a few details in my opinion. Namely that there's no end in sight until the incentive structures for the conflict change - they keep discussing the same talking points as to their reasons for fighting, and I don't mean to suggest here that they are wrong.\n\nHowever, this conflict cannot, and will not, end  anytime soon because no one wants it to end. And I don't mean it in the sense of that no one is trying, but that the various incentives on both sides are towards disunity and conflict. As it stands, the central government is, shockingly, more stable with rebellion and militias running rampant than it would be without these armed factions to deal with due to rife factionalism within the government proper. The militias (on both sides, because while M23 and various anti-government militias do exist, there are at least as many pro-Kinshasa militias, which have the same incentive structure to perpetuate the conflict) have no incentive to end because of their various rackets, and both sides get so much money and assorted assistance from foreign support that any disruption to the status quo, sadly, would be far, far, more destabilizing to the country and region than this continued conflict.\n",
        "Comment 68: ima need the soundtrack to this episode\n",
        "Comment 69: I feel sorry for them and everyone in and around this conflict. It's been such a long and gruesome conflict evolving and combining itself over time with other conflicts. Its like a very bad circle of injustice and hatred from many sides. \nWill it ever end, that is the question of the decade 😑\n",
        "Comment 70: Africa does not have gun and ammunition factories, which means all of these guns and weapons are imported. Who keeps giving them these weapons and funding these tribal wars?\n",
        "Comment 71: Congo is the definition of a country that collectively scarred and traumatized \nSince independence this country has never had peace\nI pray for it\n",
        "Comment 72: Love that song they’re singing  in the opening part of the video. Song about life and death.\n",
        "Comment 73: I have to say that Vice reporting has improved greatly in the last year. Fantastic video, thank you for bringing awareness to this\n",
        "Comment 74: Damn vice doing good journalism 👏\n",

[Applause] the general is welcomed here by people living just a few miles from advancing m-23 soldiers foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] civilians and rebels fighting with other groups foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] to us right now how close is the threat foreign do you feel ready to with these new recruits to be in battle with them in the next few days and I see you're fighting alongside and for the same cause as the National military why is that after you've been on the other side in the past foreign [Applause] accusing M23 of being funded by Rwanda maybe even Uganda can you tell me where you get your funding she said so how are you managing to pay for all of these guys weapons comms equipment you have no one even local support foreign have you given any thought to what's going to happen after you defeat M23 what will happen to all of these different factions of Rebel groups and army foreign new Rebel coalitions the town fell to M23 just a few weeks later as the Army and rebel groups Scramble for new recruits M23 has vowed to continue their offensive to push the government into negotiating with them they claim they're protecting the tootsie minority in eastern Congo and accuse the government of not honoring their previous peace agreement after months of resisting media coverage raising suspicions that they're hiding Rwandan soldiers in their ranks are contacts with the group gave us 24 hours notice to meet them at their military headquarters to reach their territory we had to leave Congo the group then facilitated our entry through Rwanda and Uganda foreign so we're just crossing into Congo from Uganda and it's at a border post that's been closed for the last year because of the conflict here this is the first town that M23 took when they were going back into Congo when we got here at first they weren't going to let us cross they wouldn't let us take the car but it seems like they're letting us cross now [Music] foreign [Applause] evidence that M23 is massacring civilians the group's leaders finally agreed to talk to the Press ures killing me an important at a press conference to defend themselves against allegations by the UN about civilian deaths the group's political leader batra basimwa also insisted Congo's Tootsie population are facing a genocide is a [Music] foreign [Music] so I understand that you've said the Congolese government are the ones who started the war today at your press conference you also denied any responsibility for these massacres that the UN said killed at least 170 people are you at any point going to take some responsibility for the impact of the war here is foreign you have used the word genocide a lot that's a very inflammatory word to use here sitting on the border of Rwanda and Congo and there's no evidence yet that the discrimination against the tootsie Congolese population is anywhere close to a genocide at the current moment foreign the wonderful exterminations do you categorically deny like the other leaders of M23 that you have any backing Financial or logistical from Rwanda or Uganda but you could have the support of Rwanda and Uganda without having the full support of their armies there's U.N group of experts reports eyewitness accounts of Rwandan forces on the ground reports of funding and logistical support do you deny all of that after pushing him on Rwanda our interview was cut short and we were asked to leave the country earlier than planned so these m-23 soldiers are just escorting us back to the Ugandan border that we crossed this morning we're not entirely sure why it's such a rush originally they told us we could stay a bit longer but they suddenly said that we had to go Rwandan authorities denied a repeated request for an interview but told Vice news quote Rwanda has no interest in perpetuating a conflict on its borders or being drawn into an internal conflict in the DRC adding the accusations of the UN group of experts are without basis even in the face of an international war with Rwanda Congo's government has much more than M23 to contend with it the population's anger is boiling over into sustained protests against the perceived failure of the government and the U.N to protect people [Music] the un's menusco peacekeeping mission is one of the largest and oldest in the world it has a billion dollar annual budget and peacekeepers and bases across the country but resentment against the blue helmets has been building for years as poorly armed Rebels continue to Massacre civilians in towns with large UN forces [Music] organizers like Jackson Zahara are behind the protests demanding for the UN to leave the country is rallying participants for another protest to demand that foreign troops the U.N and Regional forces from East Africa leave Congo to fight its own battles why is there such intense anger even when this population is being attacked by Rebel groups in their area why are they so angry at the U.N color is [Music] no job business so you don't think it would have any impact if all these troops all of these weapons that are supposed to protect people here just disappeared tomorrow existed Continental foreign [Music] [Music] anti-un protests have turned deadly at least 29 civilians and four U.N peacekeepers died in protests where U.N facilities were ransacked and looted throughout Eastern Congo [Music] despite the risks people still turned up in downtown Goma to join since Sahara's team these protesters are trying to make it to the center of the city outside one of the big U.N peacekeeping bases there but the police the governor and the U.N have all asked them to call it off already [Music] so it looks like about a quarter of the protesters actually made it here to the U.N the police stopped a bunch of them in town they arrested some journalists these guys at least are going to try and do a sit-in here [Music] but as soon as police descended the remaining protesters had to run M23 has surrounded Goma and vows to take the city again frustrated and Angry Young Congolese people like Esperance say this fight is the last straw in the endless violence they've experienced do you think in your lifetime that Eastern Congo can be totally at peace and rid of all of these Rebel groups [Music] I'm Michael lermont editor-in-chief of Vice

      "trans_summary": "The YouTube video discusses the ongoing conflict in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which has been plagued by war for 25 years. The conflict has resulted in over 6 million deaths, making it the deadliest global conflict since World War II. The current conflict is centered around the M23 Rebels, a group formed by the minority Tutsi ethnic group, who are fighting against the Congolese government.\n\nThe video highlights the role of neighboring countries, particularly Rwanda and Uganda, in fueling the conflict by backing proxy militias to extract minerals such as coltan and gold. Rwanda denies meddling in the DRC, but a leaked UN report confirms that Rwandan troops are supporting the M23 Rebels.\n\nThe video also features interviews with civilians, including Esperance, who has lost family members in previous conflicts and is now joining the fight against the M23 Rebels. Esperance believes that Rwanda is responsible for the conflict and that the Congolese government is not doing enough to protect its citizens.\n\nThe video also explores the role of the UN peacekeeping mission in the DRC, which has a billion-dollar annual budget but has been criticized for its ineffectiveness in protecting civilians. The video features footage of protests against the UN, which have turned deadly, with at least 29 civilians and four UN peacekeepers killed.\n\nThe video concludes by highlighting the frustration and anger of the Congolese people, who feel that the conflict is endless and that the international community is not doing enough to help. The video ends with a call to action, encouraging viewers to support Vice News' journalism and to consider making a contribution to help bring attention to the conflict in the DRC.\n\nKey points:\n\n* The conflict in the Eastern DRC has resulted in over 6 million deaths and has been ongoing for 25 years.\n* The M23 Rebels are fighting against the Congolese government, with neighboring countries Rwanda and Uganda providing support.\n* Rwanda denies meddling in the DRC, but a leaked UN report confirms that Rwandan troops are supporting the M23 Rebels.\n* The UN peacekeeping mission in the DRC has a billion-dollar annual budget but has been criticized for its ineffectiveness in protecting civilians.\n* Protests against the UN have turned deadly, with at least 29 civilians and four UN peacekeepers killed.\n* The Congolese people are frustrated and angry about the endless conflict and feel that the international community is not doing enough to help.",

      "transcript": "I want to share with you a few tips on how to avoid taxes legally my name is Brian Kim my legal disclaimer is I am a certified public accountant so I'm a CPA I do encourage you to speak with your accountants if you don't have one then I hope you enjoy this free information before we begin I do have a request if I help you save money with this video then my request is that you enjoy the money treat yourself out help someone else out the way I see it I'm just happy that the money stays in your hands it's better than having the IRS have your money right if you're making under 400 000 a year this video is going to be perfect for you that's because the reason why I'm saying that is if you make over 400 000 a year then you can utilize more tax tricks there's more tricks that are available to you once you get over the one million dollar threshold that's when things start getting wacky there's a lot of gray areas but in today's video we're going to stick to information for people making under four hundred thousand dollars a year and I want to be upfront with you there is no magic bullet there's no secret hack that's gonna reduce your taxes to zero that privilege that's reserved for the billionaires with sophisticated offshore entities that's I'm just I'm basically saying that's it's not for people like you and me if you want to make your taxes go to zero without the offshore entities without the army of tax attorneys then the only way to pull that off is for you to go down the illegal routes so how to avoid taxes illegally if that's what you're looking for then you're at the wrong video you clicked on the video with the title that says how to avoid taxes legally therefore in this video I'm gonna I'm gonna show you how to do it legitimately so you can save money on your taxes and you can sleep well at night I'm basically going to teach you how to nickel and dime the IRS legally and those nickels and those nickels and dimes they're going to add up now let's begin let's start off with the easy ones number one is commuter benefits your workplace offers this to you so please take advantage for 2023 you can spend up to 300 a month tax-free on commuting so that's basically a 300 tax deduction every month which is three thousand six hundred dollars a year this is applicable to mass transit such as trains Subways buses ride sharing such as Uber or Lyft parking meters parking garages parking lots and more number two retirement plans so please take advantage of retirement Plans offered by your workplace for example a 401k or a 403 b retirement plan a 401k is offered by for-profit companies a 403 b is if you're working for certain governments or non-profit organizations so when you put money into your 401k or 403b you pay less taxes this year and you're building up your retirement accounts there are more retirement plans than just the 401K or 403b but these are just the more popular ones number three HSA and HSA is a health savings accounts for people with a high deductible Health Plan when you put money into your HSA it lowers your taxable income it's a tax deduction okay so here's how it works you put money into your HSA so you can think of the HSA like a savings accounts dedicated to health related expenses so if you spend the money on qualified medical expenses then you do not pay taxes on that money so essentially you're paying for your health related expenses with pre-tax money which is awesome Additionally you can invest the money in your HSA and the earnings and interest will be tax-free number four FSA and FSA is a flexible spending accounts and FSA allows you to pay for certain health care expenses with pre-tax money which is great but I do want to warn you that there's a use it or lose it rule with the FSA if you have leftover money in your FSA by the end of the year you end up losing it unless your company has a rollover option number five dependent care FSA you can pay for child care expenses with pre-tax money you can do this for children and adult dependents you can use your pre-tax money to pay for daycare nurseries preschool nannies Au pairs babysitters day camps after school programs Adult Day Care facilities and more now let's move on to saving money and paying less taxes within Investments so number six we have Capital losses if you have cryptocurrency losses make sure that you report them because losses are good for tax purposes losses are tax deductions so when it comes to stocks you will receive a tax form the 1099 B and your stock losses will be accounted for on that tax form so when it comes to stock losses they're pretty hard to overlook they're pretty hard to miss I'm bringing up cryptos specifically because in many instances you are not provided a year-end tax form and many people forget to report their crypto losses or many people are just too lazy to report them but you're throwing away money to the IRS if you don't number seven long-term capital gains if you hold on to a stock or a crypto for more than a year before selling it that is classified as a long-term capital gain long-term capital gains receive much better tax treatments the tax rate for long-term capital gains it's about half your regular tax rates and if you're under a certain income threshold you will qualify for a zero percent tax rate in that case you will pay zero taxes at the federal level your profits will be 100 tax free number eight review your 1099-b tax form the 1099-b is the year-end tax statement for your stock market activity so you get this tax form from your brokerage account like Robinhood or Ameritrade or whoever you use so they send this to you around late January to mid-February but you can also download the 1099b from your brokerage account you just have to go to the tax section in your app or on their website with this 1099 B tax form just gloss over it make sure that there are no obvious mistakes I want to tell you about the most common mistake that I see that makes people pay more tax than they should on your 109b tax form if you see some information that's blank or missing that could cost you a lot of money and I see this happen all the time your 1099-b says how much you bought a stock for and how much you sold it for if the how much you bought it for is missing you know for whatever reason then it looks like you bought it for zero dollars and then whatever you sold it for it looks like pure profits and then you're gonna erroneously end up paying a lot of taxes therefore look out for obvious errors like that number nine margin interest so please do not forget to deduct your margin interest you can deduct your investment interest expense and this is going to be listed on your 1099 B tax form as well I see so many people forgetting to report this because it's not listed on the cover page number 10 gambling losses so here's a random one that's actually useful because I see this quite frequently if you went to the casino and you won big on the slot machine then you will receive a tax form called a w2g we're not talking about a million dollar jackpot this is applicable if you win a few thousand dollars the casino sends a copy of your winnings to the IRS therefore if you don't report your winnings on your tax return then you will get in trouble however I want you to know that if you do get a w2g you can reduce that amount by how much money you lost gambling so the money that you lost on table games slots sports betting horse racing Etc you can use the losers to offset the winners number 11 traditional IRA so we spoke about the 401K and the 403 b those retirement plans are offered at your workplace the traditional IRAs a retirement plan that you set up outside of your work so depending on your situation you may qualify for a tax deduction for putting money into your traditional IRA so please keep that in mind number 12 529 plan if you want to put away money for Education whether it's for your child or for someone else or even for yourself you can put money into a 529 plan you will not receive a tax deduction with the IRS for funding a 529 plan however you may receive a tax deduction on your State's income taxes some states do not give a tax deduction for 529 plan contributions like California and nine states do not have state income taxes like Texas or Florida but even in those cases if you have a 529 plan you can still benefit from tax-free growth number 13 fix your W-4 payroll settings if you usually owe money to the IRS when you file your tax return in many cases you're getting charged an underpayment penalty and you don't even realize it's the penalty is listed on your tax return but many people overlook this because the penalty automatically adds to your balance due so it's Sneaky like that to prevent this you have to fix how much taxes that you have taken out of your paycheck you make that adjustment on your W-4 with your payroll departments or in your payroll settings so I made a video on how to do that I'll provide a link down below number 14 minimal rental use rule a lot of people have been listing their homes on Airbnb or similar providers if you rented out your home for 14 days or less the money that you make will be 100 tax free this is called the minimal rental use rule so make sure that you report this properly otherwise you're going to end up paying taxes which is wrong notify your accountants or look it up it's called again the minimal rental use rule so I hope this has been helpful to you I hope you pay less taxes to the IRS and again if this video helps save you money please treat yourself out treat someone else out I'm just happy for you please subscribe I thank you for the support and I wish you a very nice day",

      "transcript": "नमस्कार, दिनभर की बड़ी खबरों में आपका स्वागत है। मैं हूं आंचल। आज इस बुलेटिन में बात होगी नीतीश कुमार को लगे बड़े झटके की। बीजेपी नेता के बयान से पार्टी की बढ़ती मुश्किलों की। देखेंगे एसआईआर को लेकर चुनाव आयोग पर बढ़ते दबाव को। अखिलेश यादव ने एनडीए को दी क्या नसीहत। जानेंगे मोदी सरकार पर क्यों भड़का आरएसएस? और बुलेटिन के आखिर में देखेंगे जानेमाने कार्टूनिस्ट इरफान की किस खबर पर पड़ी तिरछी नजर। लेकिन दिनभर की तमाम बड़ी खबरों से पहले एक नजर आज की सुर्खियों पर। दुबई एयर शो में हुआ बड़ा हादसा। भारतीय फाइटर जेट तेजस हुआ क्रैश। पायलट की गई जान। संसद के शीतकालीन सत्र से पहले सरकार ने बुलाई सर्वदलीय बैठक। 30 नवंबर को सुबह 11:00 बजे होगी बैठक। 1 दिसंबर से 19 दिसंबर तक चलेगा शीतकालीन सत्र। सीजीआई बिहार गवाई का बड़ा बयान। कहा बौद्ध धर्म को मानने वाला लेकिन सेकुलर हूं। 23 नवंबर को रिटायर हो रहे हैं सीजीआई गवाई। और शेयर बाजार में गिरावट। 400 अंकों की गिरावट के साथ 85,231 पर बंद हुआ सेंसेक्स। तो, 124 अंकों की गिरावट के साथ 26,68 पर बंद हुआ निफ़ी। यह तो थी सुर्खियां। अब बात आज की सबसे बड़ी खबर की। बिहार में नीतीश सरकार में मंत्रियों के बीच विभागों का बंटवारा हो गया है और इस बंटवारे में भी नीतीश की ज्यादा चलती नहीं दिखाई दी। जेडीयू की सीटें भले ही बढ़ गई हो लेकिन नीतीश कुमार इस बार कमजोर पड़ते दिखाई दे रहे हैं। 20 साल से जिस विभाग को लेकर नीतीश कुमार हमेशा सहयोगियों के सामने अड़ जाते थे। इस बार बीजेपी के पाले में वह विभाग भी चला गया। तो कैसे कमजोर पड़ते दिखाई दे रहे हैं नीतीश जानने के लिए देखिए रिपोर्ट। नीतीश कुमार 2005 में बिहार के सीएम बने और उन्होंने गृह मंत्रालय भी अपने ही पास रखा। 2025 में हुए विधानसभा चुनाव तक गृह मंत्रालय जेडीयू के पास ही रहा और इसमें भी 19 साल तो नीतीश कुमार ही गृह मंत्री रहे। बीजेपी ने कई बार नीतीश से गृह मंत्रालय मांगा लेकिन हर बार उन्होंने बीजेपी हाईकमान को यह मंत्रालय देने से इंकार कर दिया। लेकिन इस बार नीतीश कुमार बीजेपी के सामने सरेंडर करते दिखाई दिए हैं। गृह मंत्रालय इस बार बीजेपी के सम्राट चौधरी को दिया गया है। वैसे बदले में बीजेपी के हिस्से में रहने वाला वित्त मंत्रालय नीतीश ने जेडीयू के लिए झटक लिया। जेडीयू के विजेंद्र यादव को वित्त विभाग मिला। इसके अलावा उन्हें वाणिज्य और ऊर्जा मंत्रालय भी दिया गया है। बीजेपी के नितिन नवीन को पीडब्ल्यूडी के साथ शहरी विकास और आवास मंत्रालय दिया गया है। बीजेपी के प्रदेश अध्यक्ष दिलीप जायसवाल को उद्योग मंत्री विजय सिन्हा को भूमि और राजस्व के साथ खनन और भूतत्व मंत्रालय दिया गया है। जेडीयू के श्रवण कुमार को ग्रामीण विकास कार्य और परिवहन मंत्री बनाया गया है। यानी एक बात तो साफ हो गई है कि मंत्रालय के बंटवारे में बीजेपी का दबदबा दिखाई दिया। ऐसे में अब सभी की निगाहें विधानसभा अध्यक्ष पद को लेकर हैं कि क्या यह पद भी बीजेपी के हिस्से में चला जाएगा। वैसे जिन मंत्रियों को महत्वपूर्ण मंत्रालय सौंपे गए हैं, उसे लेकर भी सवाल उठ रहे हैं। खासतौर पर जिस तरह से नीतीश सरकार में परिवारवाद का दबदबा दिखाई दिया है, उसे लेकर आरजेडी ने सवाल उठाए हैं। नीतीश सरकार में डिप्टी सीएम सहित तमाम बड़े मंत्री किसी ना किसी सियासी खानदान से जुड़े हुए हैं। जिसमें डिप्टी सीएम सम्राट चौधरी का नाम भी शामिल है। ऐसे में विपक्ष ने नीतीश सरकार को घेर लिया है जो विपक्ष पर परिवारवाद का आरोप लगाते रहे हैं। नीतीश कुमार को बीजेपी ने बड़ा झटका दे दिया है। तो मुश्किलों में बीजेपी भी दिखाई दे रही है। बिहार चुनाव में विपक्ष बीजेपी पर रिश्वतखोरी का आरोप लगा रहा था और अब बीजेपी के नेता ने ही विपक्ष के आरोपों पर मोहर लगा दी है। बीजेपी के उस नेता ने जिसने नरेंद्र मोदी के लिए अपनी सीट छोड़ी थी। उसने ऐसा बयान दिया है जिसकी चर्चा जोरों पर है तो कौन है वह नेता और क्या कुछ कहा उन्होंने जानने के लिए देखिए यह रिपोर्ट। 14 नवंबर को बिहार की बाजी एनडीए ने जीत ली। 20 नवंबर को जेडीयू नेता नीतीश कुमार ने 10वीं बार सीएम पद की शपथ ली। लेकिन इन सबके बीच विपक्ष एक मुद्दे को लेकर बीजेपी पर भड़का हुआ है और वह मुद्दा है रिश्वतखोरी का। दरअसल बिहार चुनाव से पहले बीजेपी ने मुख्यमंत्री महिला सम्मान योजना की शुरुआत की थी जिसके तहत हर महिला के खाते में ₹10,000 ट्रांसफर किए जा रहे थे। इस योजना का विपक्ष ने जमकर विरोध किया और इसे चुनाव से पहले रिश्वतखोरी करार दिया। अब खास बात यह है कि विपक्ष के बाद अब बीजेपी के वरिष्ठ नेता मुरली मनोहर जोशी ने चुनाव से पहले पैसे बांटने को लेकर एनडीए पर तंज कसा है। उन्होंने कहा कि विकास का अर्थ चुनावों में पैसे बांटना नहीं है। देश में आर्थिक असमानता ही सबसे बड़ा भेदभाव बन चुकी है। कल्याणकारी कार्य चुनावों में पैसा बांटने से नहीं होते हैं। आज लोग सवाल उठाते हैं कि चुनाव से पहले कैश बांटा जा रहा है। सरकार कहती है कि ऐसा वेलफेयर के लिए किया जा रहा है। लेकिन लोग कहते हैं कि आप वोट खरीदने के लिए पैसे बांटते हैं। बता दें कि मुरली मनोहर जोशी का यह बयान ऐसे समय में आया है जब बिहार चुनाव के नतीजों को लेकर सियासत में घमासान मचा हुआ है। विपक्ष लगातार नतीजों में धांधली के आरोप लगा रहा है और नतीजों की समीक्षा करने की चेतावनी भी दे रहा है। इस बीच अब देखना यह होगा कि बीजेपी अपने ही नेता के दिए हुए बयान पर क्या सफाई देती है। बीजेपी नेता के बयान से पूरा एनडीए फंसता दिखाई दे रहा है। तो एसआईआर को लेकर चुनाव आयोग पर दबाव बढ़ता जा रहा है। यह मामला कोर्ट में चल रहा है। अब इसके दूसरे चरण को लेकर तमाम राज्यों ने याचिकाएं दाखिल की हैं। जिसे लेकर अब सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने चुनाव आयोग को नोटिस जारी कर दिया है। वहीं इस बीच पश्चिम बंगाल में टीएमसी ने इसे लेकर अपनी कवायद तेज कर दी है। तो क्या है पूरी खबर जानेंगे इस रिपोर्ट में। एसआईआर की वैधता को चुनौती देने वाली याचिकाओं पर सुप्रीम कोर्ट सुनवाई के लिए तैयार हो गया है। यह याचिकाएं केरल, बंगाल, तमिलनाडु समेत तमाम राज्यों की तरफ से दाखिल की गई हैं। जस्टिस सूर्यकांत, जस्टिस एसवी एन भट्टी और जस्टिस जॉय मौलिया बागची की पीठ ने अब इसे लेकर चुनाव आयोग को नोटिस जारी किया है। पीठ ने केरल में एसआईआर को चुनौती देने वाली याचिकाओं को 26 नवंबर के लिए तत्काल सूचीबद्ध करने का निर्देश दिया क्योंकि वहां स्थानीय निकाय चुनाव करीब है। याचिकाकर्ता की तरफ से सीनियर वकील कपिल सिब्बल ने इस पर जोर दिया। वहीं दूसरे राज्यों की याचिकाओं पर दिसंबर के पहले या दूसरे हफ्ते में सुनवाई होगी। जैसा आप जानते हैं कि सुप्रीम कोर्ट पहले से ही पूरे भारत में एसआईआर कराने के चुनाव आयोग के फैसले की वैधता की जांच कर रहा है और अब उसने दूसरे चरण को लेकर दाखिल याचिकाओं पर चुनाव आयोग से जवाब मांग लिया है। वहीं इस बीच पश्चिम बंगाल में भी एसआईआर को लेकर विवाद गहरा गया है। मुख्यमंत्री ममता बनर्जी ने एक दिन पहले एसआईआर को योजना विहीन, अव्यवस्थित और खतरनाक बताते हुए चुनाव आयोग को चिट्ठी लिखी थी और इस प्रक्रिया को रोकने की बात कही थी। अब इसके जवाब में नेता प्रतिपक्ष शुभेंदु अधिकारी ने चुनाव आयोग को पत्र लिखा और आरोप लगाया कि ममता बनर्जी का संदेश आयोग के संवैधानिक अधिकार को कमजोर करने की कोशिश है। इसी सिलसिले में अब सत्तारूढ़ टीएमसी 24 नवंबर को पार्टी के महासचिव अभिषेक बनर्जी की अध्यक्षता में एक आंतरिक बैठक करेगी ताकि यह सुनिश्चित किया जा सके कि वोटर लिस्ट में कोई भी नाम ना छूटे। वहीं अगले ही दिन यानी 25 नवंबर को टीएमसी एसआईआर के खिलाफ एक रैली का भी आयोजन कर सकती है। एसआईआर के खिलाफ टीएमसी मोर्चा खुलने की तैयारी में है। तो तैयारी यूपी विधानसभा चुनाव को लेकर भी तेज है। पार्टियों ने कमर कस ली है। बिहार के बाद बीजेपी यूपी में भी लगातार जीत के दावे कर रही है। लेकिन इस बीच सपा प्रमुख अखिलेश यादव ने बड़ा दावा कर दिया है। साथ ही बीजेपी पर निशाना भी साधा है। तो क्या कुछ कहा अखिलेश यादव ने? जानने के लिए देखिए यह रिपोर्ट। सपा प्रमुख अखिलेश यादव ने आज यानी 21 नवंबर को प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस कर सरकार को तमाम मुद्दों पर घेरा है। साथ ही बिहार में एनडीए की बंपर जीत पर भी हमला बोला। बिहार जीत के जश्न में डूबे एनडीए को अखिलेश ने अभी से सचेत करना शुरू कर दिया है कि यूपी में सरकार बनाना बीजेपी के लिए आसान नहीं होने वाला। उन्होंने बीजेपी पर निशाना साधते हुए कहा कि जब आप दूसरों को तकलीफ दोगे तो कुदरत अपना फैसला करेगी। जीत तो सिकंदर को भी अमर नहीं कर पाई। साथ ही उन्होंने बीजेपी के उस वादे को पूरी तरह से फेल बताया जिसमें बीजेपी ने गंगा रिवर फ्रंट को साफ करने की बात कही थी। साथ ही अखिलेश ने यह भी कहा कि बीजेपी या तो 1000 साल पीछे का सोचती है या फिर 2047 का। नालों पर रिवर फ्रंट कहां बनते हैं? बताइए आप। आपने सपना दिखाया मां गंगा को साफ करेंगे। बीजेपी के लोग 1000 साल पहले सोचते हैं पीछे का या और आगे का सोचते हैं। 2047 उनका जुबानी हमला यहीं नहीं रुका। उन्होंने सड़क चौड़ीकरण जैसे स्थानीय मुद्दों पर सरकार को घेरते हुए बीजेपी को नकारात्मक और छोटी सोच का बताया है। सबसे बड़ी बात तो यह है कि भाजपाई जो नेगेटिव है, नकारात्मक है, संकीर्ण सोच है। वो कैसे चौरीगढ़ की बात कर रहे हैं हम? चौड़ीकरण भाजपा की संकीर्ण सियासत की साजिश है। यह साजिश कर रही है। ये चौड़ीकरण जो कर रही हैं ये भाजपा की संकीर्ण सियासत की साजिश है। इसके साथ ही उन्होंने बीजेपी पर डिवाइड एंड रूल का रास्ता अपनाने के आरोप भी लगाए। उन्होंने बीजेपी पर निशाना साधते हुए साफ कहा है कि बीजेपी अपने पॉलिटिकल प्रोजेक्ट्स को पूरा करने के लिए डिवाइड एंड रूल यानी फूट डालो और राजनीति करो का रास्ता अपनाकर समाज में नफरत फैलाती है। करीब आधे घंटे की इस प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस में अखिलेश यादव ने बीजेपी को स्थानीय मुद्दों से लेकर राष्ट्रीय मुद्दों पर जमकर घेरा। वहीं यह भी माना जा रहा है कि अखिलेश के इन हमलों का असर यूपी की राजनीति में बड़ा उलटफेर कर सकते हैं क्योंकि सपा प्रमुख जमकर बीजेपी के खिलाफ मोर्चा खोल रहे हैं जिससे बीजेपी सक्त में आ सकती है। अखिलेश यादव ने बीजेपी को जमकर घेरा है। तो मोहन भागवत के बयान से भी मोदी सरकार घिर गई है। मणिपुर में हिंसा भड़कने के बाद पहली बार आरएसएस प्रमुख मोहन भागवत दौरे पर पहुंचे। इस दौरान वह मोदी सरकार पर भड़क उठे। उन्होंने मोदी सरकार को नसीहत तक दे दी। तो क्या कुछ कहा आरएसएस प्रमुख ने जानेंगे इस रिपोर्ट में। मणिपुर में 2023 में भड़की जातीय हिंसा के बाद अब हालात सामान्य होते दिखाई दे रहे हैं। ऐसे में आरएसएस प्रमुख मोहन भागवत मणिपुर पहुंचे हैं और उनका यह हिंसा के बाद पहला मणिपुर दौरा है। इस दौरान मोहन भागवत ने कुछ ऐसा कह दिया जो मोदी सरकार के लिए निशाने के तौर पर देखा जा रहा है। संघ प्रमुख ने इंफाल में आयोजित कार्यक्रम में सामाजिक एकता पर जोर दिया। साथ ही उन्होंने मणिपुर में सरकार गठन को लेकर भी बड़ी बात कही। संघ प्रमुख मोहन भागवत ने कार्यक्रम के दौरान कहा, सरकार और पार्टियों के मामलों में मैं बहुत हस्तक्षेप नहीं करता। लेकिन मणिपुर में सरकार अवश्य होनी चाहिए। मेरी जानकारी के अनुसार इसके लिए प्रयास किए जा रहे हैं। विनाश होने में 2 मिनट का समय लगता है। लेकिन निर्माण में 2 साल लगते हैं। इन कठिन परिस्थितियों में भी मणिपुर के लोगों को अलग-अलग आधारों पर बिखरने से बचाने के लिए निरंतर कोशिश की गई। हम निश्चित रूप से सभी को साथ लेकर चलेंगे। अब जिस तरह से मोहन भागवत का बयान सामने आया है उसे मोदी सरकार से जोड़कर देखा जा रहा है। उन्होंने अपने इस बयान के जरिए हिंसा के लिए मोदी सरकार को घेरा है क्योंकि लगभग 2ाई साल से ज्यादा वक्त से मणिपुर हिंसा से जूझ रहा है। कुकीजों और मैते समुदाय के बीच संघर्ष में 250 से ज्यादा लोगों की जान जा चुकी है। हजारों लोग बेघर हो गए। लेकिन सरकार इस हिंसा को रोकने में नाकाम साबित हुई। फरवरी में एनरेन सिंह को मुख्यमंत्री के पद से इस्तीफा देना पड़ा। जिसके बाद से मणिपुर में राष्ट्रपति शासन लागू है। ऐसे में विपक्ष तो सवाल कर ही रहा है लेकिन अब मोहन भागवत के बयान से भी मोदी सरकार घिर गई है। सवाल उठ रहे हैं कि मणिपुर में शांति कब बहाल होगी? तो सवाल दिल्ली हिंसा के आरोपियों की जमानत को लेकर भी बने हुए हैं। सुप्रीम कोर्ट में आज इस मामले में सुनवाई हुई। इस दौरान दिल्ली पुलिस की तरफ से एएसजी राजू ने अपनी दलीलें पेश की। उन्होंने साफ कह दिया कि यह आरोपी जमानत के हकदार नहीं है। तो क्या कुछ हुआ सुप्रीम कोर्ट में सुनवाई के दौरान? जानने के लिए देखिए यह रिपोर्ट। सुप्रीम कोर्ट में 2020 के दिल्ली हिंसा मामले से जुड़े मामलों में आरोपी उमर खालिद और शजील इमाम सहित अन्य की जमानत याचिकाओं पर अहम सुनवाई हुई। दिल्ली पुलिस की तरफ से पेश हुए असिस्टेंट सॉलसिटर जनरल एसवी राजू ने तर्क दिया कि यह एक आतंकवादी साजिश का स्पष्ट मामला है और इसलिए यूएपीए की धारा 43 डी5 के तहत यह आरोपी जमानत के हकदार नहीं है। एएसजी राजू ने पीठ को बताया कि हिंसा में 53 लोग मारे गए और 513 घायल हुए जिसमें फायर आर्म्स, पेट्रोल बम और एसिड का इस्तेमाल हुआ। पहली चार्जशीट 16 सितंबर 2020 को और दूसरी चार्जशीट 22 नवंबर 2020 को दायर की गई थी। चार्जशीट में आईपीसी की धारा 302, 307 और यूएपीए की धारा 13, 16 और 18 लगाई गई है। एएसजी ने विशेष रूप से यूएपीए की धारा 16 एक ए का उल्लेख किया जिसमें जान लेने तक की सजा का प्रावधान है। उन्होंने जोर देकर कहा किकि आरोप पहली नजर में सही लगते हैं और कॉग्निजेंस लेने के आदेश को चुनौती नहीं दी गई है। इसलिए यूएपीए की धारा 435 के तहत जमानत नहीं मिलनी चाहिए। एएसजी राजू ने साजिश के बड़े इरादे पर जोर दिया जिसमें जरूरी दूध पानी की सप्लाई में रुकावट और असम को भारत से हटाने के लिए चक्का जाम का इस्तेमाल करना शामिल था। उन्होंने पश्चिम बंगाल में हुई हिंसा का भी हवाला दिया। जहां रेलवे को 70 करोड़ से ज्यादा का नुकसान हुआ था। इसे आर्थिक तबाही के इरादे से उन्होंने जोड़ा। साथ ही एएसजी ने टेरर फाइनेंसिंग का भी दावा किया। जैसे ताहिर हुसैन पर शेल कंपनियों के जरिए 1.3 करोड़ की फंडिंग का आरोप। शफा उर रहमान पर 8.90 लाख और मीरान हैदर पर 2.86 लाख की फंडिंग का आरोप। उन्होंने उमर खालिद को चक्का जाम की साजिश रचने और हिंदुस्तान के टुकड़े-टुकड़े कर दो जैसे भाषण देने वाला बताया। एएसजी ने निष्कर्ष दिया कि यह एक सिस्टेटिक प्लान था जिसका बड़ा मकसद शासन बदलना था और इस साजिश में शामिल लोग लाठी, एसिड और बंदूक लेकर आए थे। कोर्ट ने आगे कहा कि सुनवाई 24 नवंबर को लंच के बाद जारी रहेगी। दिल्ली हिंसा मामला लगातार सुर्खियों में बना हुआ है। तो चर्चा द नेहरू अर्काइव को लेकर भी हो रही है। देश के पहले प्रधानमंत्री जवाहरलाल नेहरू की नीतियों को छात्रों युवाओं तक पहुंचाने के लिए कांग्रेस ने बड़ा कदम उठाया है। पार्टी ने नेहरू के कामों की ऑनलाइन लाइब्रेरी को लाइव कर दिया है। जिसमें पूर्व पीएम के बचपन से लेकर आजादी के बाद तक की कुछ तस्वीरें भी हैं। जिस पर कांग्रेस सांसद राहुल गांधी का बयान आया है। तो क्या कुछ कहा राहुल गांधी ने जानेंगे इस रिपोर्ट में। देश को आजादी दिलाने में अहम भूमिका रखने वाले और पहले प्रधानमंत्री पंडित जवाहरलाल नेहरू के विचारों और नीतियों को सभी तक पहुंचाने के लिए कांग्रेस ने बड़ा फैसला किया है। जवाहरलाल नेहरू मेमोरियल फंड नेहरू आका.in नामक एक वेबसाइट लांच की है। जिसके जरिए नेहरू के चुनिंदा बौद्धिक कामों के बारे में जान सकते हैं। नेहरू आका लाइव में उनके बचपन से लेकर आजादी के बाद तक की कई फोटो भी हैं। इस संग्रह में 75,000 पृष्ठ और 3,000 फोटो शामिल है। दूसरे चरण में नेहरू के पत्रों को भी शामिल किया जाएगा। संग्रह में 35,000 दस्तावेज, फोटो, ऑडियो, वीडियो और नेहरू की किताबें हैं। इसमें नेहरू की कृतियों का 100 वॉल्यूम का पूरा सेट शामिल है। जिन्हें डिजिटाइज किया गया है और इन्हें फ्री में डाउनलोड किया जा सकता है। यह वेबसाइट मोबाइल फोन फ्रेंडली है। इस पर कांग्रेस सांसद राहुल गांधी की प्रतिक्रिया आई है। राहुल ने इस वेबसाइट का फोटो शेयर करते हुए एक्स पर पोस्ट किया कि नेहरू का लेखन सिर्फ इतिहास नहीं बल्कि भारत की विकसित होती अंतरात्मा का अभिलेख है। हमारे देश की लोकतांत्रिक यात्रा, उसका साहस, उसके संदेहों, उसके सपनों को समझने की चाह रखने वाले किसी भी व्यक्ति के लिए उनके शब्द एक शक्तिशाली दिशा सूचक है। राहुल ने आगे कहा कि मुझे खुशी है कि यह विरासत आप सभी के लिए खुली, खोज योग्य और मुफ्त है। इसका विस्तार होता रहेगा। और बुलेटिन के आखिर में देखेंगे जाने-माने कार्टूनिस्ट इरफान की कि इस खबर पर पड़ी तिरछी नजर। [संगीत] नईनई चुनी गई नीती सरकार में सुशासन अब कैसा होने वाला है इसका अंदाजा आपको इस बात से लग जाएगा कि बिहार में एनडीए के एक नेता हैं जिनका नाम है उपेंद्र कुशवाहा उनके बेटे को जो राजनीति की ए बी सी डी भी नहीं जानता है उसको नीतीश सरकार के मंत्रिमंडल में मंत्री बना लिया गया। उसने चुनाव भी नहीं लड़ा है। उसकी खासियत क्या है? उसकी खासियत केवल ये है कि वो विदेशों में पढ़कर आया है। अब आप अंदाजा लगा सकते हैं कि आने वाले जो दिन है उसमें किस तरह के लोग काम करेंगे और किस तरह की सरकार काम करेगी। चलिए भाई अगर इससे जनता को शिकायत होती है तो क्या है? जनता को ₹100 जैसे अभी दिए गए थे उसी तरह से 55000 और दे दिए जाएंगे ताकि उनका मुंह बंद हो जाए क्योंकि ये फार्मूला तो जबान बंद करने का आ ही चुका है यहां। [संगीत] बहुत-बहुत शुक्रिया इरफान जी। तो आज इस बुलेटिन में बस इतना ही। आप देखते रहिए डीबी लाइव। नमस्कार [संगीत]",

      "transcript": "Bienvenido a este nuevo vídeo usted que \nes tapicero a lo mejor se pregunte por   qué tapicería para aficionados ese es \nel título que le puse a este vídeo bueno   porque a mi propio punto de vista no se \nrequiere la experiencia para hacer lo que   yo voy a hacer a continuación cualquier \npersona con ver este vídeo lo va a hacer   y claro la actitud es bien importante siempre \nantes de empezar un trabajo no tiene que ser   positivo este es el asiento de una chevy silverado \npero no necesariamente tiene que ser chevy puede   ser el asiento de una yukon o de una chevy tajo o \nincluso de una suburban el procedimiento va a ser   muy similar hasta incluso si el automóvil es fort \no es nissan o es toyota el procedimiento va a ser   no igual pero un poco similar yo le doy la idea \nque como usted lo puede hacer ya desde es cuestión   de que usted ve el vídeo y empiece a trabajar \nsi es que está teniendo este detallito con su   automóvil usted puede ver cómo está eso nos sirve \nse repara eso sí se puede reparar se va a echar de   ver si ha sido reparado no se va a echar de ver \nsi ha sido reparado claro todo depende el tipo   de reparación que usted le haga la funda se hay \nque cambiarla o hacerla nueva o comprar la funda   hecha definitivamente la espuma se repara esto el \ncliente lo ha comprado la funda nueva ha comprado   la espuma nueva y yo simplemente la voy a estar \ntrae dos tornillos en la parte de enfrente de ese   asiento usted simplemente lo va a quitar y baja la \ngracia lo va a jalar hacia enfrente es la punta el   cliente la compra esto lo venden en internet \nes la espuma el cliente la compró usted puede   hacer lo mismo si es que no tiene conocimiento de \ntapicería o sobre tapicería ese es el calentón yo   lo voy a estar poniendo ya removió el asiento el \nprocedimiento para re moverse es fácil el asiento   por lo que por lo visto o la funda del asiento \ndel cliente la compró en este lugar does it sab el cliente lo trajo ya yo simplemente lo voy a \nestar instalando y voy a hacer todo lo posible   por que quede bien me imagino que si tiene \nla espuma nueva y el foro ha sido cortado   muy bien esto va a quedar bien lo primero que \nusted va a hacer es remover la funda vieja   en la funda vieja trae unos plásticos esos \nplásticos agarran el metal en el hierro y   usted tiene que removerlos mucho cuidado si \nusted no tiene experiencia haciendo esto pueda   que usted sea una cortadora en los dedos póngase \nunos guantes así es que no tiene experiencia es   mi mejor consejo que le doy ahí ya tengo removida \nla funda del hierro yo nomás necesito el hierro no   necesito la espuma como tengo una espuma nueva que \nel cliente la trabajo yo nomás remuevo el hierro y esto un poco pegada a la espuma eso es normal \nusted la tiene que despegar aquí yo ya tengo lo   que es el hierro asegúrese que el hierro no esté \ncortado asegúrese que la malla de alambre esté   en muy buenas condiciones si la malla no está en \nbuenas condiciones yo le aconsejo que la repare   este asiento trae un material bien resistente \na la parte de abajo no hay que ponerle tela   yo siempre les pongo un material adicional \npara que no rompa la espuma pero este trae   un material bien resistente eso es para que el \nhierro o la malla no rompa la espuma entonces   yo lo pego usted va a ser lo mismo usted puede \nutilizar un bote de este pegamento yo le voy   a poner el la calefacción simplemente usted la \npega y la acomoda más o menos es todo y yo ya la   como de ellos les puse pegamento está acomodada \nusted va a hacer lo mismo lo mismo no todos los   asientos que traen calefacción cuando el asiento \ntrae calefacción tiende a dañarse más rápido   porque porque todo está la piel rápido tiende a \nencoger la piel rápido cuando la piel se encoge   a la funda va quedando más apretada y es cuando \ntiende a romperse a descoserse este asiento trae   unos velcros esos velcro van a pegar en la \nparte de abajo de la espuma siempre usted   va a hacer eso si no trae velcro pueda que \natraiga unas varillas y usted le va a tocar   que en gran pared o usted va a ir acomodando \nla funda poco a poco a como de las si usted   a si la funda está bien hecha pero usted no la \nacomoda bien va a parecer que la funda no está   bien hecha así es que como de la bien haga lo \nmáximo posible si necesita espuma usted le va   a tener que poner espuma porque muchas veces la \nfunda vienen un poco flojas cuando son de cuero   porque el [ __ ] de cuero tiende a encoger con \nel tiempo es por eso que las hacen un poco flojas allí está y lo puede ver usted lo todo se ve \nque está quedando arrugado así le quedan pocas   arrugas no se preocupe póngalo al sol póngale a \nun poquito de agua caliente póngale el plancha   póngale un poquito de a estimar si es que tiene y \neso le sale si las arrugas son demasiado o puede   que necesite un poquito de espuma extra \ny si agregando la espuma extra todavía   le sigue quedando arrugado no se preocupen \nel [ __ ] va a encoger con el tiempo claro y vamos a empezar a hacer que esta funda \nentrante o el plástico que trae la funda   entrante en ese hierro te lo va a \nir hablando lo va a ir acomodando y ahí lo estoy poniendo te va a ser lo mismo lo vais hablando poco a poco \nsi usted lo jala y levanta batallando busque ayuda   que alguien le haga presión hacia abajo mientras \nusted jala el [ __ ] y lo en trampa en ese hierro y ahora estoy poniendo este lado siempre jalando \ny asegurándome que esa funda entré en esa parte   requiere un poco de paciencia porque \na los plásticos no son los originales   los plásticos originales traen hasta la forma \nincluso en donde está la curva y este no está   es un plástico derecho simplemente lo han \ncosido allí y yo tengo que forzarlo amoldarlo   a la forma que tiene eso este va a ser los \nmismos paciencia es lo que va a necesitar la parte de atrás está un poco escasa   esto es normal que pase es normal esto usted \ntiene que jalarlo así y si un lado acaso está   demasiado escasa y no alcanza a llegar en donde \ntraslapa usted le tiene que poner unos tornillos   alargo lo más que pueda y ponerle unos tornillos \nes así como lo va a hacer quedar pero ahí quedó   simplemente tengo que acomodar bien esta funda \njalarla en las esquinas más que todo acomodar   la y esas arrugas le van a salir no son muchas \narrugas déjenme decirles es todo eso le va a salir hay que ponerle también unos tornillos en   la parte de enfrente para que estar \nseguro de que esa funda no se salga ella ya está esa forma este cable es \nsimplemente lo dejó por fuera y ahí está   allí está les puse unos tornillos en la parte \nde enfrente les puse un poquito de agua caliente   y todavía le falta todavía le falta un poquito \ny si usted ha armado la funda y le queda así no   se preocupe a la funda está bien armada esas \ndobleces o arrugas que le han quedado esto le   va a salir con el sol y si usted está insatisfecho \nporque le quedaron esas arrugas bueno agregarle un   poquito más de espuma y eso lo va a sacar 100% \naquí hubo un corte lleva unos switch que es lo   que hace que se mueve el asiento hace enfrente \no hacia atrás o hacia arriba o hacia abajo usted   tiene que hacer un hoyo usted toca empuja y siente \nel filo del hierro usted marca en ese filo no va   a cortar sobre la marca no estoy como yo voy a \ncortar y no se le olvide suscribirse al canal y   dale clic a la campana hago como una especie de \ny acostada y hago un corte acá también ahí está   y ahí entra el switch y yo lo apretó lo conecto y \nya si usted por haber motivo este a se le complica   esto simplemente tomarle una fotografía cuando \nusted lo esté desarmando porque en caso que   usted no se recuerde cómo es que va usted tiene \nesa fotografía ese vídeo que sin duda le van a   ser de gran utilidad a la hora de armarlo ahí \nestá bien importante esa marca usted no corte   más allá de esa marca hacia adentro sí pero \nhacia afuera de esa marca no ahí ya está armado tengo vídeos relacionados al proceso más \nprofundo de cómo hacer una funda similar a   ésta desde cero como reparar la espuma por \nsi usted no puede comprar la espuma por si   usted no puede comprar la funda ya hecha y se \nanima en hacer el trabajo desde cero bueno yo   tengo esos vídeos que sin duda a usted le van a \nayudar usted ve en la esquina superior derecha   de su dispositivo móvil o su computadora una \ncajita blanca bueno y que lea esta cajita esta   cajita lo va a llevar a un vídeo en donde yo \nmuestro cómo hacer una funda similar a la que   usted ha visto como yo lo instalo desde cero yo \nla voy a cortar la voy a coser y la voy a armar   así es que si usted quiere hacer un proyecto \nsimilar a ese de cero bueno yo le aconsejo que   vaya y vea ese vídeo recuerda es el propósito \nde mi vídeo es simplemente darles ideas sobre   lo que esta pizzería así es que lo invito a \nusted a que se suscriba al canal que le dé   clic a la campana de esta manera usted desea \nmantener al día actualizado en cuanto a todo   el material que yo estoy compartiendo \nen este canal

      "transcript": "hi this is Anil and welcome to the video tutorial for the learning lad on C++ programming so in this tutorial we're going to learn about the switch statement n C++ so in the tutorial on if statement you know we have learned that using the if statement we we can compare the value of a variable using the comparison operators let's say in your program you want to check whether the value of a variable equal to a bunch of values at that time what we can do is we can use the if if and else if and we can form the condition using the equal to operator but in C++ we have something called switch so this switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values so each value is called a case and the variable being switch on is checked for each case so I return the syntax tax of the switch statement here so as you guys can see here to use this switch we need to write the keyword switch and here we need to write an expression so this expression must evaluate to an integral or enumerated type so whatever the value we're going to have here or whatever the result of the expression that we can have here will be compared to each and every value placed in this case statements so this case is are nothing but one of the values you know that we want to compare with the result of this expression or with the value stored in this variable we specify here so we can have as many case statements we want so this case statement is going to contain a value that will be compared to the value of this expression and if that value is matched then we can execute the statement in that particular case or in that particular block once we execute the statement that we wanted to execute then to come out of the switch statement we're going to use the break statement and um we can have a default block you know it will be executed or the statements of a default block will be executed if none of our case matches the result of the expression or the value stor in expression so if it's confusing don't worry you know while programming you know you guys can understand easily all right now I'm going to delete all these things and we're going to write a program so here just for the demonstration purpose we're going to compare the grade of a user with the various values for example if the user has a grade A then we're going to say okay you got the grade A you're excellent if he has the Grade B then we're going to say okay not bad like that all right first I'm going to create a character variable so it's going to be care and I'm going to call it as input all right and next I'm going to use a switch statement to use the switch statement we need to write the keyword switch and then a pair of parenthesis so between this parenthesis we need to write the expression or the variable that we want to compare with a bunch of other values so here in this case we want to compare the value of this input variable that's why I'm going to write the input here so it can be an expression all right but make sure that when we use an expression you know the result of that expression must result in integral or enumerator type next we're going to write a pair of curly bres and between this curly Braes we need to write the case statements so this case statements are nothing but the value that we want to compare with this input so this input variable may contain a value a b c or D so here what we're going to do is we're going to write case a I'm going to write capital A and since it is a character it should be written in single codes then colon and then if you guys want you guys can form a code block by using this curly braces I use this because you know when I use this you know I can place the code neatly so here within this block I'm going to write the statements that I want to execute so here we're going to say see out we're going to say excellent and next if you guys want to write any statements you guys can write but here we just want to write only this much and we need to write the break statement to come out of this switch after executing this case and then I'm going to copy this case and I'm going to paste it in a next line and two more times okay next next I'm going to change this one to B and the message is going to be very good and this is going to be C and the message is going to be good and this is going to be D and the message is going to be okay not bad all right so I'm going to save this one right now and we're going to initialize this input variable with a of a so I'm going to write capital A because you know we have used capital A here and I'm going to save this I'm going to build and run this so you guys can see it says excellent so that's because what happened here is you know this input variable was containing the value a so that value will be compared with the values which we have in these cases so first it is compared with this case a and at that time it matches and that's why the statements inside that block or the statements in the case a block will be executed excellent and then we have the break statement that's why the control comes out of this switch statement and you know it just executes the other statements so we're going to have done grading all right before that let's include a new line so it's going to be end line all right right I'm going to save this and run it again so now you guys can see excellent break statement and it comes out of this switch and continues to execute the other code the next thing is if we change this one to let's say C and run this you know it says good done grading and um you know similarly if if the value is b or d then it's going to execute the particular or the respective block block so I'm going to save this one the next thing I want to teach you is about the default block or the default case so in a switch statement we can have a default case so this default case or the statements that we going to write in this default case will be executed if the result of this expression or or whatever the value we have in this variable will not match any of the values of these cases at that time the default block will be executed to write a default block we need to write the keyword default and then the colum then um you know this CES are optional but I'm going to write it because you know you know it allows me to organize the code properly and we're going to say um don't know your grade all right I'm going to save this one and here we going to change this one to let's say y now we have y you know and none of these case values are going to match this value F and that's why this default block will be executed and it's going to say don't know your grade I'm going to save this one I'm going to build and run this so it says don't know your grade all right and also I don't know whether you guys have noticed or not you know we are not using the break statement inside this default case if you guys want you can use that but this is of no use because this break statement is used in a case just to come out of the switch statement after executing the statements of a particular case and since this default case is always written at the end you know after executing the statements of the default case you know the control will automatically come out of this switch statement so that's why we're not using the break statement or you know it's not necessary to use the break statement in the default case here if we didn't have this break statement what happens is you know and if we had the value y then this case a will be matched and this CR out statement will be executed and and then the other statements in this switch will be executed so it's going to execute excellent then very good and then we have the break that's why it's going to come out of this so just to demonstrate that I'm going to build run this so now you guys can see here we have excellent then very good and then done grading because of this break the control comes out of this switch statement so I'm going to close this one and the next thing that I want you guys to teach is if you want to execute the same statements for different values of cases then you guys can combine them so here we have case a and we are executing this see out statement let me add a break before okay now I want to execute these statements for the case small a also so I can combine that so this can be case and small a and again the column and uh you know these statements in this block will be executed if this input variable contains a capital A or a small a so you guys can combine that so I'm going to change this one to small a you know just for the demonstration purpose and I'm going to build and run this so now you guys can see we got excellent so similarly you guys can write as many case statements you want in your program and you guys can U you know group as many cases to execute the same code and the next thing is the data type of the constant expression or the data type of a case value must be same as the data type of the result of this expression in the switch so if this case value has character data type then this switch variable must have a character data type and if it is int it should be int so this is it guys this is about the switch statement in C++ thank you for watching and don't forget to subscribe to my channel if you guys have any doubt don't hesitate to ask us and like our Facebook page at facebook.com/ learninglad and I'll see you in the next tutorial",

      "trans_summary": "The YouTube video is a tutorial on the switch statement in C++ programming. The tutorial is presented by Anil from the Learning Lad channel.\n\n**What is a Switch Statement?**\n\nA switch statement is a control structure in C++ that allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. It is used when you want to perform different actions based on the value of a variable.\n\n**Syntax of Switch Statement**\n\nThe syntax of a switch statement is as follows:\n\n```c\nswitch (expression) {\n    case value1:\n        // code to be executed if expression == value1\n        break;\n    case value2:\n        // code to be executed if expression == value2\n        break;\n    default:\n        // code to be executed if expression does not match any value\n        break;\n}\n```\n\n**How Switch Statement Works**\n\nIn a switch statement, the expression is evaluated, and its value is compared with the values in the case statements. If a match is found, the code in the corresponding case block is executed. If no match is found, the default block is executed.\n\n**Example Program**\n\nAnil presents an example program that uses a switch statement to determine the grade of a student based on their input. The program uses a character variable `input` to store the grade, and a switch statement to compare the input with different values.\n\n```c\nchar input;\ncout << \"Enter your grade (A, B, C, D): \";\ncin >> input;\n\nswitch (input) {\n    case 'A':\n        cout << \"Excellent\";\n        break;\n    case 'B':\n        cout << \"Very Good\";\n        break;\n    case 'C':\n        cout << \"Good\";\n        break;\n    case 'D':\n        cout << \"Okay\";\n        break;\n    default:\n        cout << \"Don't know your grade\";\n        break;\n}\n```\n\n**Default Block**\n\nThe default block is used to specify a set of statements to be executed if the expression does not match any of the values in the case statements. In the example program, the default block is used to print \"Don't know your grade\" if the input is not one of the expected values.\n\n**Combining Case Statements**\n\nAnil also shows how to combine case statements to execute the same code for different values. For example, you can use `case 'A':` and `case 'a':` to execute the same code for both uppercase and lowercase 'A'.\n\n**Data Type of Case Value**\n\nThe data type of the case value must be the same as the data type of the result of the expression in the switch statement. For example, if the expression is a character, the case value must also be a character.\n\nOverall, the tutorial provides a clear explanation of the switch statement in C++ and how to use it in a program.",

      "transcript": "alors aujourd'hui on fait du gigot d'agneau au barbecue de deux façons enfin rumé Laurent aujourd'hui on a deux superbes gigot d'agneau qui nous viennent de chez guardampas et de l'agneau français de l'agneau français et c'est du second cru de l'agneau de Pauillac donc l'avion de Pauillac qui est une référence dans notre région en IGP et là c'est le second cru donc vous allez sur le site de voir la pampa tout est très bien expliqué alors on va faire ça en deux façons on va faire une première façon au camado on va venir le marquer et ensuite derrière on va faire une cuisson indirecte et Laurent enfin voilà une deuxième façon en cocotte pareil on va faire quand même un premier marquage au cabado et puis ensuite on va le faire mijoter Napoléon Napoléon dans une cocotte dessus effectivement on met un petit robe tout simple un petit robe ça parce que de notre ami rafale on va frotter les viandes avec une gousse d'ail ensuite on va mettre un petit peu d'huile d'olive on va aller badigeonner avec les herbes en cuisson avec les herbes dans la cocotte alors au niveau de la température interne il y a plein de possibilités effectivement vous pouvez l'avoir Scénic vous pouvez l'avoir vous pouvez l'avoir bien cuit en gros il faut aller chercher entre 56 degrés et 70 oui donc nous on va chercher on le veut rose et donc on va aller chercher entre allez on va le faire simple entre 56 et 60 degrés on va venir chercher cette température interne pour avoir un agneau qui nous convient voilà j'ai coupé l'ail donc je me suis gardé une gousse d'ail pour frotter les gigots avec une gousse d'ail celui qu'on va faire en cocotte en cocotte moi j'aime bien faire de l'ail chemisé et puis ensuite j'ai coupé des petits morceaux d'ail pour venir les insérer dans la viande vous voyez hop alors juste une petite incision avec le couteau et là vous le faites ouais j'en mets à peu près 3 3 4 sur le dessus là ici de ce côté là trois quarts oui et puis ils sont beaux ils sont vraiment voilà donc comme ça et alors et voyez après tu frotte d'accord ouais je frotte un peu la viande un petit peu d'huile du coup dessus c'est un petit peu d'huile d'olive qui vient de la map juste pour faire accrocher le robe c'est un massage vous avez vu un massage ça fait longtemps qu'on n'a pas fait le massage on vous met la recette dans la description ça c'est le petit robe de Rafa [Musique] on marque la viande du coup allez alors là on a allumé notre Canado on est à 280 degrés là on va juste faire un marquage on va y en a des très belles flammes allez voilà très bien marqué nos viandes déjà ça sent bon regardez ça du coup je le marque du côté le petit c'est beau ça alors on les sorts allez ici sur le Canado je vais me passer en indirect et ici on baisse on va se mettre voilà à peu près un quart donc là on va mettre un déflecteur demi-lune donc ici le déflecteur était posé donc la cuisson indirecte je rappelle c'est la viande n'est pas en contact avec la flamme et là tu mets la viande et là je mets la viande du côté des vecteurs côté des facteurs ça sent le tail ça sent pareil un quart je réduis un carré également on va mettre une petite sonde je vais prendre le numéro 1 allez et donc là je vais la planter dans un endroit alors je rappelle vos sondes toujours là à l'horizontale par rapport à la plaque donc là l'idée c'est de pourquoi et pourquoi c'est pour pas traverser Laurent très bien un qui suit là ça prend on va prendre deux températures ça me prend ici une température dans le barbecue et à l'intérieur la température à l'intérieur de la viande et c'est parti hop on va mettre la cocotte donc là l'huile d'olive de la map ah bah lui il est chaude impeccable [Musique] on va faire chemiser donc ça veut dire de l'ail avec la peau j'adore ça et puis vous restez des gousses d'ail donc hop et alors là ce que j'aime bien faire badigeon et ma viande avec les herbes je vais la retourner là c'est sympa d'avoir un beau marquage comme ça ça fait envie je te passe la sonde allez on va voir aussi bien que moi non ouais c'est pas mal ouais c'est bien Laurent [Musique] quand même je vais faire B on va baisser le feu donc pas besoin de couvercle de la cocotte puisque vous allez fermer le barbecue pour pas avoir le feu sous la cocotte on va éteindre nos deux feux du milieu et les deux feux sur les côtés on les laisse on les baisse un peu on va surveiller on va voir ce que ça donne en température mais je pense qu'il faut les laisser comme ça on les baissera légèrement on va l'idée c'est que ça soit 180 degrés voilà l'idée 180 200 on est à environ une heure et quart de cuisson à peu près et c'est assez rigolo que ça soit sur le camadon on vous montre 57 58 ça se suit et de se suivre en interne donc là on va pouvoir on va l'arrêter on va arrêter les on va pas tarder à les arrêter on va juste mettre les haricots dans quelques haricots qu'on va mettre de la cocotte des petits des petits flageolets verts mais avant on va vous montrer à quoi ça ressemble déjà à l'intérieur allez regardez c'est très joli très joli c'est magnifique sur le calvado on vous montre aussi à quoi ça ressemble regardez la couleur on voit que ça commence à décoder de l'os petit flageolet qu'on a préparé pourquoi on vient de mettre les haricots on attend 5 minutes et puis bah on va sortir ça vous dresser une belle assiette nos deux gigots d'agneau sont prêts on est à 60 degrés en interne exactement alors c'est une cuisson qui est très rapide on est sur 1h15 je vous rappelle qu'on a fait une épaule d'agneau en effiloché qui ça n'a rien à voir les filochets c'est très bon aussi on a fait une vidéo là dessus on vous montre l'effet de chez daniaux vous allez avoir effectivement un agneau qui est délicieux qui est effiloché la cuisson classique au four voilà comme au four exactement et ben écoutez on vous montre à quoi ça ressemble c'est parti [Musique] donc vous voyez ce que ça donne ça c'est la cuisson donc au gaz classique en cocotte donc ça vous pouvez le reproduire sur du dans le même dans un four classique tout à fait et donc l'autre au Canado alors on va commencer par découper celle-là moi c'est la cuisson que je préfère puis on voit bien les live franchement voilà c'est c'est la cuisson comme ça qu'on cherchait donc voilà c'est très jolie on va couper l'autre également ouais je te laisse faire l'autre franchement on est sur une cuisson similaire ah ouais c'est de toute façon il y a pas avec la sonde il y a pas de il y a pas de miracle voilà magnifique regardez allez l'Europe vient vraiment emporter on a pas salé on n'a pas poivré moi je dors franchement je goûte curieux de voir s'il va y avoir une différence avec le kamado moi je suis alors peut-être un petit peu de haricots tu as peut-être ce goût du résultat de Dufour oui mais là on a l'esprit barbecue Nathalie cette petite croûte là de toute façon on le voit la couleur moi j'ai une préférence avec la cuisson au kamado parce que il y a vraiment ce goût fumé oui [Musique] on voit la facilité du barbecue gaz et puis voilà on est très très proche de ce que vous pouvez reproduire chez vous au four pour que c'est vrai que au goût la cuisson à kamado est vraiment top vous avez vu en plus le marquage était le marquage des magnifiques au kamado il y a le petit plus un petit côté fumé qui est pas qui est subtiles quand on mange la croûte donc vraiment à l'aveugle il y a une différence on vous mentirait si on vous disait l'inverse mais maintenant franchement les deux sont cuits de la même manière ce qu'on là où on a halluciné avec Laurent sa température la température interne franchement c'est quand même rare des fois même même morceau sur la même barbecue ça cuit pas la même vitesse là les deux ont cuit mais vraiment de manière équivalente nous étions un symbiose les températures étaient vraiment voilà c'était synchro et pourtant il y a un vrai différence réglage de température est pas facile et là on est à 200 degrés sur les côtés 1h15 nickel et là vous avez votre plat du dimanche si vous avez aimé cette vidéo n'hésitez pas un petit pouce un commentaire et on s'abonne et on n'oublie pas la petite cloche alors aujourd'hui on vous faites du gigot d'agneau de Pauillac en dehors et alors moi je trouve que c'est assez sympa de vous le montrer maintenant parce que Pâques va vite arriver et il va falloir préparer vos petites recettes d'agneau ça je mettrais pas parce que c'est temporalisé ça ah bon voici des gens regardent la vidéo en juillet tu dis pas que tu vas bientôt arriver de pas quand juillet c'est pas grave [Musique] c'est nouveau ça on va parler maintenant je te jure si des masseuses nous regardent mais on est preneur aussi les preneurs à défaut si on trouve une masseuse mais bon là pour moi la cuisson kamado à prendre dessus [Musique]",

La première méthode consiste à marquer les gigots d'agneau au camado (un type de barbecue) en les faisant passer sous les flammes pour obtenir un marquage uniforme. Ensuite, les gigots sont placés dans la partie indirecte du barbecue pour cuire à une température de 180 degrés pendant environ 1 heure et quart.\n2. La deuxième méthode consiste à faire cuire les gigots d'agneau dans une cocotte au barbecue. Les gigots sont marqués au camado puis placés dans la cocotte avec de l'huile d'olive, des herbes et des gousses d'ail. La cocotte est ensuite placée dans la partie indirecte du barbecue pour cuire à une température de 180 degrés pendant environ 1 heure et quart.\n\nLes deux méthodes donnent des résultats similaires, avec des gigots d'agneau cuits à point et délicieux.

        "Comment 1: Als Motorradfahrer und 90er Civic Fahrer ist und bleibt Honda für mich eine Herzensmarke ♥\n",
        "Comment 2: Hab den jetzt seit 1,5 Jahren und bin mehr als zufrieden. Verarbeitung und Qualität kann locker mit den deutschen Premiumherstellern mithalten.\n",
        "Comment 3: Ich arbeite bei Honda und bin dementsprechend voreingenommen. Es war wirklich cool mal eine Meinung von \"außerhalb\" zu hören! Sehr gutes Video!\n",
        "Comment 4: Ich komme von einem Golf GTI Performance und bin von diesem Honda Civic eHEV Advance, den ich seit 7 Monate fahre, begeistert. Kein Getriebe, kein Turbo die kaputt gehen können; minimal im Verbrauch; größerer Kofferraum als der Standard-Golf, kein fahrender „Kasten“, Bose-Anlage, 750km Reichweite mit kleinem Tank für 35.000€. Das Warten hat sich gelohnt. Ich habe mein Auto gefunden für die nächsten Jahre.\n",
        "Comment 5: Hätte ich nie gedacht dass ich bei Honda landen könnte... Der Innenraum mit hapischer Funktionalität durch physische Tasten und Drehreglegler ist heutzutage wirklich das wahre Premium. Bravo Honda! Ich werde den Civic Probefahren.\n",
        "Comment 6: Mach mal bitte „Warum kauft niemand den c63s E-Performance AMG“\n",
        "Comment 7: Jaa danke für das Review, meine Familie fährt sein 15 Jahren Honda und wir sind sehr von den Autos überzeugt. Umso mehr freue ich mich wenn ein Profi wie du das auch so sieht. Ich hoffe das es evtl einige Menschen erreicht❤\n",
        "Comment 8: Ich finde Honda Fahrer sind grundsätzlich Menschen die Autos vergleichen und nicht der Masse hinterher gehen.\n",
        "Comment 9: Fahre den Civic schon 1,5 Jahre und freue mich immer noch jedes mal wenn ich einsteige.\n",
        "Comment 10: Honda Civic ❤❤❤ das beste Auto das man kaufen kann, nie kaputt und absolut zuverlässig ich habe schon alle möglichen Hondamodelle gehabt und auch die zwei Vorgänger von ihm besitze ich !\nBeste Automarke, während alle anderen den Geist aufgeben und ständig teure Reparaturen beim pickerl haben weil die Bauteile ständig mit dem Rotstift aufs Minimum reduziert werden wie bei den Deutschen Herstellern schmunzelt man als Hondafahrer nur.\nEinen Honda mit einem VW zu vergleichen grenzt ja schon fast an eine Beleidigung.\nEine eigenständige Marke wo nicht nur der Profit zählt sondern die Liebe zum Automobilbau , wo nicht 100000 Marken dazu gehören sondern ein richtiger Hersteller der auf Qualität und inovation setzt, wie man es haben will als Kunde!\n",
        "Comment 11: Fahre den Civic seit März 24 und wirklich sehr begeistert: der Wagen fährt sich absolut lässig und sparsam. Lediglich auf der Autobahn verliert das Hybridsystem seine Vorteile. Ich fahre nur Landstraße und Stadt und der Verbrauch auf den letzten 6500 km lag lt. Anzeige bei 4,4 ltr. Im Sommer kann ich durchaus unter 4,4 ltr. fahren (teilweise sogar unter4!), im Winter liegt der Verbrauch doch höher bei um 5-5,5 ltr. (was ja immer noch ok ist). Die Fahreigenschaften und die Ausstattung (Sport) sind super!!\n",
        "Comment 12: Es ist unverständlich, warum der Civic in Deutschland ein Nischenprodukt ist und bleibt.\nFahre dieses Modell seit knapp 40tsd km und muss sagen, der beste Civic den ich hatte. Er schlägt vom Verbrauch sogar meinen letzten 1.6L Diesel, welcher schon sparsam war.\nFahre rund 100km am Tag. Landstrasse, Dörfer und viel bergab bergauf. (500 Höhenmeter jeden Abend hinauf). Im Schnitt laufen 4.5L auf 100km aus dem kleinen Tank. Weniger geht kaum😊\nZur Verarbeitung kann ich nur sagen, im Vergleich zu seinen Vorgängern ein Meilensprung. Könnte auch daran liegen, dass das Fahrzeug nicht mehr in GB produziert wird😅\nMaterialien dürften wohl Geschmackssache sein. Wobei viele andere Fahrzeuge mit etwas besseren Materialien, aber auch gleicher Ausstattung, durchaus 10k und mehr teurer sind.\nAls geräumiges Pendlerfahrzeug ist der Civic XI perfekt.\n\nDanke für deinen Beitrag. Echt gelungen😊\n",
        "Comment 13: Bin auch einen gefahren. Und man muss es Einfach sagen, das Fahrverhalten ist Weltmeisterlich. Ausstattung ein Traum. Schade das so ein Auto wie Golf Ihn in den Schatten stellt.\n",
        "Comment 14: Hab den Honda Civic Type R Baujahr 2021 mit 320 PS. Ich bin mit dem Auto so zufrieden was Fahreigenschaften, Leistung und Aussehen angeht, möchte mit keinem anderen Auto tauschen.\n",
        "Comment 15: Also ich fahre diese Auto nun schon seit mehr als einem Jahr.\nIch komme auf einen durschnittverbauch von 4,6L\nEs gibt wirklich nichts was mich stört. Uns sehr besonders für mich, dieses Auto steht nicht an jeder Ecke. Immer ein Highlight einen anderen überhaupt mal zu sehen.\n",
        "Comment 16: Der deutsche Automarkt ist generell seltsam. RAV4, Prius, Civic, camry, sentra, Altima sind so coole Autos zu guten Preisen, gibt es hier nicht, und wenn doch, wird kaum gekauft.\n\nWeltweit sind das DIE Autos\n",
        "Comment 17: Honda und mitsubishi hatten so tolle Modelle.\nS2000\nType R\nAccord\nGalant\nEclipse\nEvo\n3000gt\nusw.\nSchade das die Marken fast ausgestorben sind\n",
        "Comment 18: Bin ihn damals Probe gefahren, nur der Preis hat mich etwas abgeschreckt. Hab mich nachher dann für einen Mazda 3 entschieden, den ich für 10k weniger mit Vollausstattung (ausser Leder) bekommen hab\n",
        "Comment 19: Ich fahre seit 4 Jahren den Vorgänger als Type-R und bin seitdem begeistert. Kein anderes Auto bietet ein so gutes Gesamtpaket bei dieser Leistung, diesem Fahrspaß und dem günstigen Unterhalt. Außerdem volle Hütte. Alle Extras sind immer mit dabei - alle Assistenzsysteme natürlich auch.\n",
        "Comment 20: Fahre den Vorgänger Civic X Sport Plus mit 182 PS und kann auch zu diesem nur sagen, fährt sich super ;D Schön das der Civic nicht vergessen wurde :D\n",
        "Comment 21: Top Auto. Ich bin kürzlich einen gefahren. Top Fahrwerk und auch die Materialien sind auf einem top Niveau\n",
        "Comment 22: Tolles Auto, und endlich wieder ein brutal offener test, weiter so, immer deine Meinung und nicht was in ist oder was man hören will.\n",
        "Comment 23: Macht bitte auch ein Video zum Honda Jazz, viel preiswerter als der Civic und es gibt viel zu wenig Videos zur neuen Version des Jazz.\n",
        "Comment 24: Ich fahre auch ein Honda Civic und wenn ich sage, dass ich ein Honda Civic fahre, werde ich immer belächelt, obwohl sie das Auto gar nicht kennen\n",
        "Comment 25: Gab unter anderem auch so wenig Zulassungen weil es ewige Lieferzeiten gab wenn man überhaupt bestellen durfte.\n",
        "Comment 26: Das Antriebskonzept find ich mega interessant. Hätte ich nicht den Vorgänger, hätte ich mir den wahrscheinlich gekauft. Aber die Preispolitik, die schwindene Präsenz von Honda auf dem europäischen Markt tut ihr übriges. Honda will förmlich nicht mehr hier verfügbar sein hab ich das Gefühl. Zeigt auch die Schließung des englischen Werkes. Und in der USA ist der Type R für 45000 Dollar und der normale Civic ab 25000 Dollar verfügbar.\n",
        "Comment 27: Wir sind lange Honda gefahren (CRX, Civic, Accord, Jazz) gefahren und die waren immer top. Den CRX habe ich in der 90ern mit 80.000km gekauft und alle haben gesagt, dass der 1,6l mit 125PS völlig überzüchtet ist und mir bald um die Ohren fliegt. Ich habe ihn nicht geschont und habe ihn nach weiteren 80.000km ohne Motorenprobleme weiter verkauft.\nDer Untergang begann irgendwann um die Jahrtausendwende, als Honda alle Händlerverträge gekündigt hat und das Netz neu aufgebaut hat. Es war sehr löcherig und die neuen Händler hatten Honda häufig als Zweit- oder Drittmarke und standen nicht zu der Marke.\n",
        "Comment 28: Habe das Auto in der selben Ausstattungsvariante und Farbe letzten Monat bekommen. Bestellt habe ich ihn aber schon im Dezember 2022 und das ist auch schon eines der größten Probleme. Kurtz nach der Bestellung wurde das Auto für 9 Monate aus dem Programm genommen und dann mit einer preiserhöhung von ca. 6000 Euro wieder verkauft und da müsste ich dann auch nochmal überlegen, ob ich mit das Auto kaufe, obwohl ich jetzt weiß wie gut es ist und eigentlich sogar in gewisser Weise keine direkte Konkurrenz hat\n",
        "Comment 29: Ich hab ihn mir vor ein paar Wochen bestellt und kann ihn hoffentlich am Wochenende abholen ☺️\n\nIn England sieht man viele auf der Straße, hier betragen die Lieferzeiten nur 2-4 Wochen. In Deutschland warnte der Händler vor mehr als 6 Monaten. Auch bei Finanzierung gibt Honda zurzeit keine Deals, in UK ganz im Gegenteil, da gibt's das Wartungspaket geschenkt und ordentlich Rabatte. \n\nAber das Auto fährt sich wirklich traumhaft und macht überraschend viel Spaß\n",
        "Comment 30: Danke für den Test. \nDu kannst ja mal beim Honda Händler nachfragen warum die Leute den nicht kaufen. \n\nEs gibt schlicht und ergreifend für den deutschen Markt nur sehr wenige. Unser Honda Händler sagte das Honda selbst ab und zu Verkaufsfenster öffnet. Wer da nicht schnell genug ist hat Pech gehabt. Lieferzeiten bis zu 1 Jahr tun da ihr übriges. Dazu noch geringe Kontingente für Deutschland mit um die 1200 Fahrzeuge.\n",
        "Comment 31: Schönes auto, aber bei der Motorisierung, die Zulast und den frechen Preis braucht sich Honda nicht wundern, dass niemand die Kiste kauft\n",
        "Comment 32: Danke, ein Video, dass es auf den Punkt bringt. Ich hoffe, Honda sieht das und reagiert entsprechend darauf. Tugenden weiter erhalten und Fehler beheben.\n",
        "Comment 33: Gutes Review zu einem guten, optisch gelungenen Fahrzeug. Allerdings ist der Honda schon recht hochpreisig. Eine passende Alternative ist der Mazda 3,  zumindest, wenn es nicht vorrangig um das Platzangebot geht. Er hebt sich ebenfalls aus der Masse ab, ist qualitativ ebenso hochwertig und auch ein recht  sportlicher Kompakter.\n",
        "Comment 34: Optisch wirklich wahnsinnig toll gelungen, innen wie außen\n",
        "Comment 35: Honda ist einfach die beste Marke. Und vor allem sind Hondas ausgereift und haben nicht die Standard Probleme wie alle anderen Autos. Die Autos sind sowas von unanfällig für irgendwas nur Wartung keine Reparaturen. Wie bei VW und anderen Marken steuerketten klappern ölverlust und die ganze andere Probleme.\n",
        "Comment 36: Den Hauptpunkt habt ihr bei Punkt 2 genannt (der Preis) Fahre auch einen Civic von 2016 der hat mich als Jahreswagen 15500€ gekostet in der Vollaustattung hatte er damals einen Preis von knapp 29000.\n",
        "Comment 37: Ach gott was lieb ich die Vergleiche auf diesen Kanal :D\n",
        "Comment 38: Also ich bin mit dem Type R FL5 sehr zufrieden :)\n",
        "Comment 39: Der direkte Konkurrent is der Corolla Hybrid 2.0 GR Sport.\nDer ist sogar etwas teurer, ähnliches Tankvolumen, mega\n Ausstattung, sowie Verarbeitung und verkauft sich mehr als alle aufgezählten Fahrzeuge.\nTja woran liegt das ;-)\n",
        "Comment 40: Hab mir für knapp 20k den Vorgänger geholt. 2j alt mit \"nur\" 126 ps als Benziner und mir gefällt der sehr sehr gut. Optisch macht die neue Generation schon was her.. aber bei meinem Händler stand der für 47.900€, das kann ich mir beim besten willen nicht leisten. Mal schauen ob es nach diesem hier doch eine andere Marke wird.\n",
        "Comment 41: John Cena fährt den Type R als Daily\n",
        "Comment 42: Er hört sich deswegen so gut an, da Honda die Mororengeräusche über die Lautsprecher laufen lässt😂\n",
        "Comment 43: Tolles Video! Finde das Honda sehr unterschätzt wird und sehr schade, dass diese Marke hier zu Lande nicht mehr Präsenz hat. Das ist in anderen Ländern deutlich anders. Ich fahre den Vorgänger (FK7) und hier ist das Zusammenspiel von CVT auch mega gelöst. Für mich ein tolles Auto was noch aggressiver aussieht als der 11er Civic.\n",
        "Comment 44: Also ich muss jetzt auch mal meinen Satz zu dem Auto sagen. Als ich dieses Video vor 5 Monaten gesehen habe war ich hin und weg. Ich suchte zu dem Zeitpunkt ein zuverlässiges, sparsames, dennoch aufregendes und schickes Auto, was nicht jeder hat und welches sportlich kann aber nicht muss. Mein alter Kia taugte nicht mehr zum TÜV. Dazu dieses Blau , omg. Jetzt 4000 km später muss ich sagen ich bereue keinen Cent davon. Ich habe diesen blauen Civic in Grundausstattung für 32790 Euro (NEU!) bekommen. Dazu 1300 Euro für so ähnliche Felgen von Borbet und damit habe ich gleich 2 Reifensätze. Das Auto ist einfach der Hammer. Logischerweise kann ich bisher keine Mängel feststellen aber das sollte man ja auch erwarten. Dazu die Garantie um 3 Jahre erweitert für 390 Euro. Nun 5 Jahre Herstellergarantie. Ich bin jung und auch noch in meinen \"wilden Jahren\", genieße daher den Fakt, dass das Auto 180 Elektro-PS hat und ca. 300 Nm. Aber wirklich glänzen tut der Civic, wenn man auch gern sparsam unterwegs ist, was ich zu 95% bin. Dann kann man den Verbrauch so richtig krass drücken. 3,3 Liter in der Stadt schaffe ich mittlerweile zu halten. auch mal größtenteils bergab unterwegs? gerne mal 0 Liter verbrauch trotz ampeln. Hypermiling auf der Autobahn: 4,0 Liter. Normales Fahren (Ottonormalverbraucher) = ziemlich exakt 5 Liter in egal welchem Modus. Mein  All-time Verbrauch bisher: 4,3 Liter. Es macht spaß ein neues, hochwertiges und schickes Auto zu haben, welches an der Ampel ziemlich ordentlich weg kommt und trotzdem für 40 Euro voll zu tanken und 800 km Reichweite zu haben ohne jemals Laden zu müssen. Danke für die Empfehlung damals! Ich liebe ihn!\n",
        "Comment 45: Ja Honda hat es drauf, habe den Honda Pilot in meiner Heimat, mit dem 3,5 Liter Machine.\nWas für ein gelungener Motor.\n",
        "Comment 46: Nach Golf7 und vor allem Golf8 Katastrophe ist dieser Honda das beste was ich je hatte.\nGanz ehrlich, VW sollte mal endlich seine Hausaufgaben machen und sich nicht nur rausreden mit dieser miesen Qualität. HONDA,alles richtig gemacht. ❤\n",
        "Comment 47: Das mit der Automatik ist genial \nNicht einen blöden Hebel schieben oder ein rad drehen .. einfach direkt den Antrieb drücken\n",
        "Comment 48: Ich hatte früher einen Civic Type S Coupe, Erstzulassung\r\n2008, mit 140 PS, der war unglaublich , Top verarbeitet, Problemfrei, viel Platz und modernes Design.\n",
        "Comment 49: Testes du den neuen Type R auch noch 🫸🫷😎\n",
        "Comment 50: Wir in Europa sind halt Steilheck und Kombi Käufer, ich glaube das ist der Hauptgrund. Wenn es jetzt eine Variante mit so einen Bodytype geben würde, wäre die wahrscheinlich erfolgreicher, würde aber auch den sportlichen Look killen, also eine der Sachen, die den Civic herausstechen lassen. Weil es gab mal einen Civic Kombi, bis 2017, aber scheinbar nicht erfolgreich genug. Das Werk in Großbritannien welches den Produziert hatte wurde vor paar Jahren geschlossen.\n",
        "Comment 51: Honda ist einer der besten Autohersteller der Welt, hier in Deutschland massiv unterschätzt. \nDer Honda Civic EHEV hat eine Vielzahl von Preisen und Auszeichnungen gewonnen, darunter \"Auto des Jahres\" von Parkers New Car Awards und \"Red Dot Award: Product Design\". Er wurde mehrfach für seine Umweltfreundlichkeit ausgezeichnet, etwa als \"Green Car of the Year\" bei den UK Car of the Year Awards und \"Eco Car of the Year\" bei den Top Gear Awards. Weitere Anerkennungen umfassen den Titel \"Best Hybrid Car\" von What Car?, \"Best Family Car\" von Auto Express, \"Best Hybrid Hatchback\" von Carwow und den Klassensieg in der Kompaktklasse beim ADAC.\n",
        "Comment 52: Sehr angenehmer und kompetenter moderator👍👍👍 macht richtig spaß anzuschauen weiter so👍👍👍👍 richtig sympathisch\n",
        "Comment 53: Der Golf hat sich weltweit etwa 35 millionen mal verkauft... davon 30 millionen in deutschland. Dagegen verkauft sich der civic weltweit auch ohne ethnonationalismus\n",
        "Comment 54: Bei uns im Umkreis haben in der Zeit nach Corona, die Honda Händler zu gemacht.\nHätte gerne wieder ein Honda gekauft, aber ohne Fachwerkstatt in der Nähe 😢\n",
        "Comment 55: Habe ihn gekauft als #fl5TypeR die civic 11 sind absolut top end.... Wer nicht zuschlägt egal ob FL4 FL5 oder FL1 mit dem grandiosen 1.5 turbo als import dem kann nicht geholfen werden für mich fehlt es an nichts und jeden Tag ist ein Genuss mit ihm zu fahren. ❤️❤️❤️❤️\n",
        "Comment 56: Faire Vorstellung, gefällt mir sehr gut der Honda. Ein Japaner wie früher.\n",
        "Comment 57: Tolles Auto, danke für die Vorstellung.\n",
        "Comment 58: Wenn Ich junger war, hatte Ich damals einen scooter Honda Dio Af27, seit diesem Zeit weiß Ich Bescheid dass Japanische Technik sind sehr zuverlässig und mit guten Geschmack konstruiert worden.\n",
        "Comment 59: Der Preis...naja, wurde kurz nach der Vorstellung von 33k auf 38k erhöht. (Grundausstattung). Unser Händler\nhat mir den Vorführer nicht verkauft, weil er keinen neuen Wagen Ordern konnte. Wartezeit bis, naja, ziemlich lange.\nDen Wagen würde ich jedem Anderen vorziehen, der fährt sich einfach nur super !!!\nInzwischen werden einige Civic im Netz recht günstig angeboten.  Werde demnächst zuschlagen 🤣👍\n",
        "Comment 60: Viele wissen nicht einmal das der Honda NSX als Benchmark für den McLaren F1 her gehalten hat Chef Ingenieur Gordon Murray war so angetan von der Fahrphysik, dem Handling, dem Fahrwerk und der Alltagstauglichkeit. Honda weis definitiv wie man Autos baut.\n",
        "Comment 61: Als ich mich dafür interessierte, musste ich im Autohaus um Infos und Probefahrt betteln. Rabatt ausgeschlossen. Dann noch 9 Monate Lieferzeit. Nein Danke.\n",
        "Comment 62: Honda hat den Civic für die US-Markt entwickelt. Für Europa wurde er nur leicht angepasst.  \"The automaker decided to target the 10th-generation Civic at the key U.S. market to give it a distinct character, which helped it become a hit.\"\n",
        "Comment 63: Ich besitze ihn nicht, teile aber die Bewertung. TOP-Auto! Steht auch nicht an jeder Ecke!\n",
        "Comment 64: Anfangs sehr gewöhnungsbedürftig zu Mat, aber mittlerweile find ich die Präsi von Daniel echt gut, nein sogar besser. ❤\n",
        "Comment 65: Vielleicht sollte man noch erwähnen, dass die Innengeräusche auf dem Niveau der Klasse wie vor 20 Jahren sind...der ADAC hat 79 dB bei 130 km/h gemessen...das machen heute Autos der Klasse deutlich besser. sowas würde ich mir heutzutage als Alltagsauto nicht mehr antun. Eigentlich schade, der Innenraum ist deutlich besser als beim z.B. Golf und die Sitzposition ist toll.\n",
        "Comment 66: Fahre nen Honda Accord, Zuverlässigkeit & Verarbeitung = Schulnote 1. War damals im großen Gebrauchttest von Dekra oder Auto-Bild (so genau weiß ich das nicht mehr) auf Platz 1 der gesamten Mittelklasse. Bis auf Bemsbelege, -scheiben und -backen gab‘s in 15 Jahren bei 140.000km bei meinem Accord nur eine Glühbirne auszutauschen, sonst nichts. Überträgt man diese Erwartungshaltung auf den neuen Civic, kann man mit dem wohl nichts falsch machen.\n",
        "Comment 67: In den USA kostet der neue Civic unter 25000€, das sind 15000€ weniger als hier, fast 40%! Dort gilt er als Anfängerauto, als Kleinwagen. Wer hier 40000€ für einen Honda Civic zahlt... trotzdem viel Spaß.\n",
        "Comment 68: Fahre den civic seit Oktober, richtig geiles Auto. Hat damals aber auch 8k weniger gekostet...\n",
        "Comment 69: Ich hab mich vor wenigen Tagen noch gefragt, warum ich davon noch keinen Einzigen in freier Wildbahn gesehen habe. Dabei sieht das Ding wirklich gut aus und Honda hat doch im Grunde einen guten Ruf, oder nicht?\n",
        "Comment 70: Sieht super aus, toll die Bedienbarkeit im Innenraum, würde ich einem Golf 8 wohl vorziehen, auch wenn selbst Mk.7 fahre. Toll auch mit dem für heute \"großen\" Motor mit elektr. Unterstützung.\n",
        "Comment 71: Honda Fahrer sind meistens Leute die sich mit Fahrzeugtechnik auskennen und selbst auch mal Wartungen durchführen. Darüberhinaus sind Honda Fahrer sehr Preis-Leistungs bewusst. Summiert gesagt, der Honda Fahrer weiß was ein gutes Auto ist.\n",
        "Comment 72: Der Civic ist sicherlich ein gutes Auto und fährt sich bestimmt gut, wobei ihm sein langer Radstand und die Länge von über 4,5 m hilft.\nAber genau das ist, was mich an dem Auto stört. Alle Wettbewerber tummeln sich zwischen 4,3 und 4,4 m und der Golf ist sogar nur 4,28 m lang, bietet trotzdem genug Sitzkomfort hinten und Kofferraum aber passt in kleinere Parklücken.\nZudem wüsste ich nicht mal, wo der nächste Honda Händler in meiner Nähe ist.\n",
        "Comment 73: Ist ja auch erstaunlich teuer.\n",
        "Comment 74: Das Cockpit ist wieder einmal Top gelungen (nicht so wie bei den Vorgängern) ! So ein Cockpit würde ich mir in den E-Autos wünschen. Dann dazu noch der 2 Liter Saugmotor (nicht so ein lächerliches 1 Liter 3 Zylinder Motörchen). Ich finde den Klasse ! Momentan fahre ich noch den 2005er Civic, aber der könnte mich sehr reizen. Leider sind die Preise noch zu hoch. Mfg\n",

31 000 Neuzulassung der Golf ist nicht 12450% besser als der Civic also was soll das 2023 waren es insgesamt nur knapp über 1000 Neuzulassung für den haben die Leute einfach vergessen dass es dieses Auto gibt der ist nämlich gut hier sind die Gründe warum dieses Auto so unbeliebt ist wie waldbrende und am Ende verrate ich euch die besten Alternativen zu diesem Auto Grund Nummer ein es gibt nur einen Antrieb die einzige Motorisierung die es gibt ist der Vollhybrid es gibt keinen reinen Benziner keinen reinen Diesel kein milhybrid kein Plugin Hybrid und es gibt ausschließlich Frontantrieb kein Allradantrieb die einzige andere Version wenn man davon sprechen kann ist der Type R aber das ist quasi ein anderes Auto und der hat dann auch schon 329 PS Grund Nummer 2 er hat einen hohen Einstiegspreis weil Hondas Motorenangebot kleiner ist als die Spannungstoleranz des briitsystems gibt es keinen kleinen günstigen Einstiegsmotor das bedeutet das Basismodell startet bei 38900 € das Auto was ihr hier seht hat die Ausstattung Sport und kostet über 40.000 €. der billigste Golf kostet beispielsweise unter 30.000 das heißt nicht dass der Civic überteuert ist der Golf hat auch eine entsprechend schlechtere Ausstattung es ist allerdings nicht verwunderlich dass ich der Civic schlecht verkauft wenn es kein Preisspektrum für unterschiedliche kundenbudgets gibt wer nicht genau dieses Auto haben will geht eben woanders hin und das machen die meisten Grund Nummer 3 er ist kein Packesel ich darf bei diesem Auto nur 397 kg zuladen das ist relativ schnell erreicht mit 5 Personen und ein bisschen Gepäck schon hinzu kommt dass die Dachlast 65 kg sind und die Anhängelast gebremst wohlgemerkt 750 kg ungebremst darf ich mit diesem Auto nur 600 kg ziehen also alleine diese 750 kg gebremst das sind Werte die andere Autos ebremst hinbekommen und entsprechend ist das hier vielleicht nicht das beste Allround Auto ein Golf kann da schon mehr und daran merkt man auch dass Honda die Prioritäten vielleicht ein bisschen falsch gesetzt hat dieses Auto ist in dieser Hinsicht kein Volumenmodell was alles so ein bisschen kann man merkt daran das grundsätzlich eher sportliche Chassis Design dieses Auto fährt grandios dazu später mehr aber es hat eben den Nachteil dass so ein Biss die Praxistauglichkeit verloren geht was auch ein bisschen nervt ist der verhältnismäßig kleine Tank 40 lit passen hier nur rein 20 mehr wären schon schön einfach damit man nicht ständig zur Tankstelle fahren muss Grund Nummer 4 ist das Platzangebot hinten das Auto ist beinah richtig gut in der Radstand von 2,70 m wird sehr gut ausgenutzt ich habe hier üppig Beinfreiheit aber sobald ich mich aufrichte ist das eher mittel wenn man über 180 ist kann man hier definitiv nicht aufrecht sitzen beim Kofferraum ist es ähnlich damit meine ich fast richtig gut die Grundfläche ist nämlich relativ großzügig 410 bis 1220 l Kofferraumvolumen habe ich wenn ich aber höher stapeln möchte ist die abfallende Dachlinie störend man kann dann auf einmal weniger einladen als man denkt dafür sieht schön aus Grund Nummer 5 es ist inzwischen eine schwache Marke vor 20 Jahren kam Honda noch auf rund 37 000 jährliche Neuzulassungen in Deutschland inzwischen sind es nur noch 6 519 das ist ein Rückgang um 82% es ist nicht eindeutig ob das nur am geringen Kundeninteresse liegt honda hat nämlich ebenso das Interesse am deutschen Markt verloren und das Angebot auf sechs Modelle zusammengestrichen dafür bekommt man immer noch eine recht gute Auswahl an Außenbordmotoren vielleicht sollten Sie den minmower hier zu Lande als Serienmodell anbieten ich hätte Lust mit 240 Sachen Rasen zu mähen das ist aber nur die halbe Wahrheit es gibt eine ganze Menge die für dieses Auto spricht z.B der aboknapp für unseren Youtube Kanal drückt den auf jeden Fall hier sind fünf Gründe für den Civic und am Ende erfahrt ihr ob es bessere Alternativen gibt die besten Preise für Neuwagen findet ihr übrigens auf kawow.de egal was du suchst bei kawow findest du das Auto das zu dir passt schnell einfach und ohne Stress spare jetzt bei Autokauf und Leasing auf kawow.de Grund Nummer ein ist die einfache Bedienung in einer Zeit in der nahzu alles mit Touch bedient wird in einem Auto ist das hier eine absolute Offenbarung ich habe echte Knöpfe die ich drehen und drücken kann für die Klimabedienung ich kann die Lamellen der luftausströmung über diese Hebel verändern es ist einfach toll dass die echt existieren am Lenkrad habe ich auch echte Tasten keine Touch Slider die man versehentlich drücken kann und dann nicht weiß was man angestellt hat sondern echte Knöpfe mit Widerstand die farmodi kann ich in der Mittelkonsole über diesen Hebel hier auswählen und wenn ich die Gänge einlegen will geht das hier das habe ich in dieser Form auch noch nie gesehen ich drücke D für vorwärts so weit so gut und wenn ich ein Rückwärtsgang haben will ist das wie als ob ich bei ein Pistole Abdrücke zack rein ich habe eine Rückfahrkamera die ich auch noch zoomen kann und dann noch mal eine Draufsicht von oben wenn ich wirklich ganz ganz feinfühlig Einparken möchte Grund Nummer 2 er ist sparsam wenn ein Auto mit einem wltp Verbrauch von 5 lit angegeben ist muss man eigentlich skeptisch sein doch in diesem Fall ist der Wert verdammt nah an der Realität in der Stadt kann es sogar sein dass er unter 5 lit verbraucht der 2 l 4erzylinder arbeitet mit zwei E-Motoren zusammen die ihre Energie aus einer kleinen 72 zellenbatterie ziehen das macht eine Systemleistung von 184 PS bei einer Mischung aus Stadt Landstraße und Autobahn bewegt sich der Durchschnittsverbrauch nur knapp über 5 l Grund Nummer 3 ist der Antriebsstrang ich bin noch kein Auto mit einem CVT Getriebe Gefahren bei dem gleichzeitig der Antriebsstrang und das Zusammenspiel aller Komponenten so fantastisch funktioniert wenn man als Autofan CVT hört denkt man sofort um Gottes Willen ich will gar nichts damit zu tun haben und das habe ich ehrlich gesagt auch gedacht bevor ich das Auto gefahren bin aber dieses Getriebe und die ab Stürmung ist einfach brillant hier passiert nicht das was man normalerweise kennt man beschleunigt vielleicht noch gerade im Elektromodus und dann kommt der Verbrenner hinzu und das macht und irgendwie ergibt klanglich nichts Sinn und es klingt furchtbar der hier klingt sogar bei höheren Geschwindigkeiten wenn man mal ausdreht richtig gut kernig böse der Hybridantrieb das sehe ich hier an der Anzeige ist wahnsinnig leise gerade wird jetzt Energie entnommen aus der Batterie und jetzt gehe ich mal in den Sportmodus bei dem der Kraftschluss übrigens auch super super gut funktioniert von 0 auf 100 in 7,9 Sekunden Höchstgeschwindigkeit sind 180 kmh das ist eigentlich gar nicht so wichtig weil aufgrund der elektroounterstützung fühlt sich das unten heraus viel schneller an da ist der Motor und er ist sofort da es gibt nur einen kurzen Kickdown Moment das klingt gut gleichzeitig ist das Chassi fantastisch die Federung funktioniert toll er gibt ein bisschen nach der Dämpfer wirkt dann entgegen ohne dass das Auto herumschwappt die Neigung links rechts ist sehr sehr gering das Auto lenkt fantastisch ein die Lenkung ist super gewichtet und das Ansprechverhalten der Lenkung aus der Mittellage heraus ist sehr direkt aber nicht super schnell also nicht so dass das Auto dadch in Unruhe versetzt wird man könnte fast denken Honda weiß was sie tun der fährt sich wirklich sportlich ich weiß nicht ob das den meisten Leuten gefallen wird aber aber ich finde das einfach super super gut Grund Nummer vier es gibt viel Ausstattung für ihn schon die Einstiegsvariante elegans hat einiges an Bord es gibt 11 Airbags Honda Connect mit Navigation Rückfahrkamera Z Zonen Klimaautomatik 17 Zoll Felgen das hier ist die Ausstattungslinie Sport deswegen hat er die schwarzen 18 Zoller serienmäßig sieht sehr cool aus wie ich finde außerdem gibt es LED Nebelscheinwerfer sportpedale und ungewöhnlich für Coupes einen Heckscheibenwischer Grund Nummer 5 das Sportmodell hat einen Handschalter in manchen Punkten ist Honda eine Marke für absolute Nerds das ist fantastisch aber es ist auch nicht verwunderlich dass die meisten Kunden kein Interesse haben ein Beispiel dafür ist der Honda Civic Type R ein 329 PS starker Fronttriebler mit sechgang Handschalter ein Meisterwerk der Fahrfreude über dieses Auto freuen sich poristen und nordschleifen Enthusiasten doch die breite Masse kann damit nichts anfangen Leute reagieren auf dieses Auto so wie auf mich wenn ich im Freundeskreis über unterschiedliche stabieinstellungen an Vorder und Hinterachse Rede sie bekommen glasige Augen und wenden sich irritiert ab die drei besten Alternativen zu diesem Auto sind es für eiglich kein Weg dran vorbei der VW Golf der Hyundai i30 und der Opel Astra aber ich bin der Meinung keines dieser Autos ist besser als das der ist wirklich grandios und ich kann nicht verstehen warum den nicht mehr Leute kaufen es ist wirklich eines der besten Autos das ich in den letzten 12 Monaten gefahren bin wenn dieses Video eine Sache bezweckt dann dass zumindest mehr Leute Probefahrten damit machen Fahrt den mal wirklich gut wenn euch dieses Video gefallen hat dann abonniert den Kanal liked geht auf ka.de für die besten Preise für neu Wagen und hier um mich herum gibt es andere Videos von uns bis zum nächsten Mal",

        "Comment 3: 聽了那麼久，覺得日本女生都會想怎樣才有女人味、怎樣男生會喜歡、怎樣小心機男生也不會發現⋯\n但台灣人的我，化妝只覺得這樣的我我喜歡、這樣我覺得自己很可愛、這樣可能不適合我但我就喜歡這個顏色🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣\n（用電視大螢幕再看了一次就再留一次言了😂\n",

        "Comment 9: 娜娜的粉絲應該男生居多，但這影片我覺得對於女生非常實用! 我經常在youtube看日本女生的化妝影片，但是因為聽不懂日文，所以只能邊看邊猜😅，這影片有中文字幕實在太好了☺! 可以讓台灣女生也能學日本女生的化妝技巧~~!! 日本女生的化妝技術真的很強大~~👍👍感謝您的分享! \n\n台灣是真的比較少在漂眉毛，所以也沒什麼相關商品，一個小建議，娜娜可以用染眉膏代替(商品外觀長得有點像睫毛膏)，一樣有改變原生眉色的效果，而且價格比較經濟實惠! 我覺得Kiss me的Heavy Rotation系列的染眉膏很好用，因為顏色選擇非常的多! 很容易能選到一個跟頭髮最相配的顏色。然後我在台灣的松本清、Tomod's都有看到，算是很好買! 若會使用蝦皮購物，在蝦皮上購買，顏色種類更多，價格一般會比實體店更便宜一點🤭但是若價差不大，直接在實體店買會比較方便!\n",

したんですよねそれめっちゃ高くて自分で もう輸入してなくてちょっともしおすめが あったら教えて欲しいんですけどこの下の 2色を使います今薄いのが結構流行ってる のでこの先っちょ真ん中先っちょの辺りに ぽよぽよとちょっと薄い色をつつける ぐらいでであの目がもし目が私めっちゃ 離れてるんですけど目がもし近いっていう 人はこの眉頭をこの辺から始めた方がいい この眉頭の色をこういうこのアイロ アイブロウコンシーラっていうのがキャン メイクからも出てて日本でもこれ人気なん ですけどコンシーラーでこの眉頭のありを 色を薄くして中盤から色をつけ るっていうのがいいと思うんですけど私の 場合は目がめっちゃ離れてるん で眉頭のところにも結構色つけますこう いう風 にこのガを太くするとめっちゃやったく 見えるんで細いはいで眉尻の方はこの濃い 色で描き ますこう描くと目尻をプーっていう風に ついで直線ででその終わりぐらいに眉 終わりがのがいいらしいんですよねこう いう風にピーっと目尻とこういう風に繋い で眉毛の終わりがここまでこういう風につ 繋いであるっていうのが自然に見える長さ らしいで眉毛かけたので眉マスカラを使う んですけど眉マスカラがずっと日本で 流行ってるのが これこれは結構みんな1回は使ったこと あるといぐらい定番なんでですけどま最近 いろんなタイプいろんなブランドが いろんなのを出してて各自良さがあるん ですけどこれはやっぱみんなが長く使っ てるだけあって結構いいと思いますで私の 色は私のは03アッシュブラウンこれを 真ん中の方からこう逆向きにこういう風に ちょっとつけて上下にこういう風に ちょっとつけて今はなんか眉毛は薄ければ 薄れほどいいみたいな時代に入ってると 思ってしっかり色消してます私は本当は色 染めたいんですけど結構結構顔の印象が 優しい感じになるじゃないないです かほら眉毛来いとなんかちょっと さちょっと学生っぽいっていうかこっちの 方がなんかお姉さんぽいじゃないですか 日本にいる時は私は眉毛をほぼ金髪ぐらい まで脱色してでさらにこれを使っててそう するともっとあの抜け感っていうか透明感 が眉毛にも出るんですけれども台湾で本当 何どれ使ってるんだろうみんなていう教え てくださいコメント欄でシェーディング これなんですけどなんか台湾でみんな使っ てるじゃないですかこれ日本でもみんな 使っててそんなにいいのかと思って買って みたら本当に良かったんですけどここが ノーズシャドウとかになっててこれがこの 辺のシェーディングですねじゃこれ使い ますこれをあの眉頭からこういう風にこう いう風に描くと結構スタンカメみたいに なるん でこの前頭のちょっと入った内側からこう いう風にちょっと内側からこういう風にC の形で入れますであのここの鼻筋をこう いう風にバーって真っすぐ入れると鼻が 長く見えるんですよ鼻が細く見えるもある んだけれどもあの最近の日本のメイクで鼻 が長く見えるっていうのが結構みんな嫌な んで可愛い顔ボームでこう鼻が高くてすっ としてると綺麗に見えるじゃないですか 最近その幼稚っぽい顔が流行ってるから ここをピーって入れずに鼻先にだけ入れ ますこういう風にここも細くしすぎると 綺麗っぽくなるんでちょっと太めにここに こういう風に入れ ますちょっとハイライトマットな方の ハイライトなんですけどこれもここに 真っすぐ入れると顔が長く見えるんで この こことここでこれアイシャドウのこの1番 薄い色を取り [音楽] ます幅とかこの目の出方とかによってアイ シャドウの色味を結構加えた方が似合う タイプの顔とアイシャドウの色をあんまり 入れない方が似合うタイプの顔があるん ですけど私はあのアイシャドウの色を いっぱい入れると目がブって埋まって 見えるんですよ例えばなんかこういう 真っすぐのものがあってこうこういう風に 当てた時に目がこの骨より内側にある人目 がちょっと外側に出てる人がいるんです けどこの目がちょっと外側に出てる人って いうのはここに色のあるアイシャドウを 塗ってもその色がしっかり見えるんですよ でも私はこの目が骨よりも中側にあるんで ここに色をいっぱい乗せると影みたいに 見えちゃうんですよねなんであの色の 少ないアイシャドウというか色味の薄い アイシャドウを控えめに塗ってますこれ 塗る範囲なんですけど目が離れてる人は私 みたいにこの内側が濃いめだと結構近寄っ て見えるとで目が寄ってる人っていうのは 外側に色を濃いめに載せると目がちょっと 離れて緩和されて見えるっていうこと逆 三角形の形になるようにこのこの辺から こういう風な逆三角形の形になるように 結構載せて ますでさっき言ったようにこのチークが こういう風になってるのが流行ってて チークと下まつげ下まぶをちょっとつまっ て見えるようにやるみたいな感じが流行っ てるらしくて汚いんですけど使いされた クリオのこのピンククリオこの下まつげの ここ にここからまっすぐこういう風に入れます こっからあの本物の目尻から 1.5mm1.5cmくらいははみ出ても なんかそんな変じゃない らしい目の横幅が大きくなるっていう感じ こうピンクでこういう風に埋めてであの 目頭の方もこういう風にピンク入れるとな ここまで目の粘膜みたいに見えて目の縦幅 も大きく見えるんですよね横幅もで ちょっと大き目のブラシでもう1回あの この薄い色をこの辺になじませ ますこれはキャンメイクの涙袋のやつの この影の色ここにちょっとこの目の黒目の 真下ありにピッピッと下にちょっと ちょっとこうちょっと上がる感じでこう いう風にこのちょっと黄色っぽいキラキラ の色 がありましてメシ側に乗せますこれは ヒロインメイクのアイライナーアイライン は目を開けたまま目をこうまっすぐ横に 伸ばす感じで描くていうのを最近編み出し てこの方が自然に引けると思います目閉じ て書くと変な変なカーブ描いたりしてこれ で横に1.5cmぐらいの幅ではみ出して いくとでまつ毛のこの間もちょっとずつ 埋めます大幅が広い人はここに結構外側 からピーっと引いても可愛いみたいなん ですけど私は二幅が全然ないのでこういう 風にまつ毛の隙間を埋めるだけで目目が遠 すぎるんでメカせかメいっつもこうやって 引いてます適当にアイラインはこういう風 に適当にやっ てでこの小さいホでこの濃い色を取って 目頭のここの影とこういう風になじませる これはあのエスパのメイクを見てあエス パってこうやって目頭せかメイクしてんだ と思って茶色い色をこういう風にこっから 入れてるんですよねここにほを描くタイプ なんで黒目の下ありにこういう風に書いて ます鼻より上にこれもあのここの距離を 短くするのに1や買ってる心でこれは本物 ですでももうちょっと濃くしますでマスカ ピューラーでまつ毛を上げて こり結構1本1本掴み掴みやすい形という かちょっと全然映らなかったんですけど1 本1本捉えてくれるんでで塗りやすいし この形も結構好きですあの台湾の化粧と 日本の化粧で1番違うのは毛かなっていう ぐらいなんか全然違うなと思うんですけど 日本のまつ毛が細く長くっていう感じでタ のまつ毛って結構ボリューム重視ですよね 砂漠というか下まつげ全然入ってないん ですけどこれで頑張って生やしますそれの シェーディングのここの色を使ってこう いう風に頬骨とかこういう風に消し ます結構結構違う感じに見えません かうんそしてこれペリペラの6番これ結構 あのこういう風につけると分かるんです けど色ありますかっていう白くないです すかていう感じなんですけどこれをけると 結構この辺のパッて明るくなる感じがして 買う前まではこんな色のチどんな美の人が 使うんやろと思ってましたけど使ったら 結構良かっ た分かりますかちょっとパッて明るくなる から見えるか結構色白っぽく見えませんか このこの目尻から鼻の下までのこの枠の中 でこういう風にこういう風に入れ るっていうのが今の流行りらしいこの キラキラの部分のハイライトを指で取り ます鼻先 にここの頬骨の高いとこ目の下のところに し反対向Cの字でこういう向き ででこの唇の真ん中のここの溝のところに ノーズシャドウの色を入れますこういう風 にでこの明るい色をこのここに入れるここ にでさっきここの目の下のところに使った このアイシャドウパレットのこのピンクの 色なんですけどこれをこの口のところの 上唇から最大で5mmぐらいはみ出してい らしく てこの端っこの [音楽] ところこの鼻と鼻から下と唇のこの距離が 短いほど幼く見えるんですよここに ちょっと5mmぐらいはみ出して鼻の下を 短く見せるっていらしいですでこれが最近 韓国で買ってきたリップこれも日本で めっちゃ流行っててバニラ70%っていう 色が一番流行ってるんですけど私も韓国 行った時にバニラ70%っていう色を買っ てきてめっちゃ可愛いと思うんですよ なんか広告とか街歩いてる女の子とかで なんかすごい唇がずっとプリプリっぽい 可愛い唇の女の子がいるじゃないですか なんかそれどうやってやってんのかなと 思ったらこのリップ使ってんだなと思って なんかめっちゃプリプリで可愛くないです か水分めっちゃ多い感じで可愛いですよね これなんか今までつけたことあるプリプリ のリップってなん結構すぐ取れたり ベタベタだっったりしなんですけどこれは あの今照明があるから結構光って見えます けど自然でめっちゃ可愛いと思うこの 70%って色があの肌の色が冷たいその レンサシーの人もマサーシーの人も両方 可愛く見えるあのちょうどいい色で もちろんそのいろんな色があって1番 似合う色とか好きな色を選べばいいんです

The interview takes place after Ninja Man's performance at the Sting festival in December. \n\nNinja Man, whose real name is Desmond Ballentine, is asked about his performance at Sting, where he handed over an illegal gun to the police. He claims it was a spontaneous action, but also mentions that he has a gun for protection in Jamaica, where he feels it's necessary due to his background and the country's social issues.\n\nThe conversation turns to his personal life, including his 23 children with 22 different women. Ninja Man defends his actions, saying that he believes children are a blessing from God and that abortion is wrong.
